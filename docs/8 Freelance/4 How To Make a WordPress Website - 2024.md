## **=>** Overview

- There are seven different steps that we need to do to create your website.

1. The first thing that we need to do is get your website name. You need a website name like `yourwebsite.com` in order to have a website.

2. The second thing that we're going to do is install WordPress. It used to be super complex, now it's super easy. WordPress is the number one way in the entire world for making a website. It's used by all of these different companies.

3. Choose your design.

- You can make literally any design that you can think of.
- You can also mix and match trillions of different designs.
- Consider the key components found in successful company websites:
  - A logo on the left side.
  - A menu on the right side.
  - A main call to action section.
  - A prove it section with numbers or testimonials.
  - Sections showing what services are offered.
  - A "why choose us" section.
  - Testimonials.
  - Final call to action.
- Integrating researched components into templates for better results.

4. Create your content.

- Base content serves as a starting point.
- Templates already include base content.

5. Paste it

- Your visitors need a place to go, like `yourwebsite.com`.
- This costs about $15 per year.

#### Getting Hosting

- The second thing we need to do is get hosting.
- Hosting is a computer that's on 24/7 with super-fast internet that holds all of your website information.
- Without hosting, your website would come up blank.
- Hosting costs about $10 per month, but I'll show you how to get a discount.

#### Installing WordPress

- The next thing we need to do is install WordPress.
- Luckily for us, WordPress is free. It's open source and popular because of it.

#### Creating Your Website

- The fourth thing we need to do is create your website.
- This could have cost thousands of dollars, but since you're doing it yourself, it's free.
- In total, with all discounts considered, your website will come out to be around $30 for the entire year.
- This is a great way to have your website spread across the entire world.
- The cost may vary slightly, but this is the base cost.
