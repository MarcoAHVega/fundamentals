<!-- This is part of the transcript of a video tutorial on web development.

help me do the following:

Write this text in its entirety, word by word, using markdown format, adding sub-headings for all its parts in h4 tags, starting every sentence with a bullet point, and using backticks for code terminology. -->

#### Starting Your Web Design Business from Home

- Today, I'm going to give you the exact sequence of steps that you need to take to start your web design business from home.
- So basically, if I had to start again from scratch, this is exactly what I would do.

#### Create a Dedicated Workspace

- First, ideally, in order to be productive, you would need your own space at home.
- You could use a spare room as your home office or fit a desk in the corner of your living room, for instance.
- That doesn't matter really, but what's important here is to have your own dedicated workspace.
- Because the moment you sit at your desk, you will automatically switch into work mode, and your mindset also will switch from destruction to complete Focus.

#### Learn How to Build Websites

- Next, you need to learn how to build websites.
- Follow any of my tutorials here on YouTube.
- Just pick one out, for instance, `how to make a car dealership website`, and then build the exact same website from scratch.
- And then the next day, do the same thing again with another one, for instance, `how to make a listing website for free`.
- Try to build one new website every day, and do that for a pair of 10 to 15 days.
- And every time you build a new website, even though it's a practice session, imagine that you're doing this for an actual client.
- The reason why is because this will train you to become critical of your own work and this will help you to make quick progress as well.
- And by the end of the 15 days period, you will have built 15 different websites, and you'll have a good grasp already of how to make a website.

#### Plan Your Business Model

- Now that you've built a few different types of websites, you are going to plan your business model.
- And this is a very important step because the web design industry is literally overcrowded.
- So if you want to stand a chance in this business, you will need to decide which target audience you want to serve.
- And I personally would advise you to be as specific as possible, like laser-focused.
- Because the more targeted your offer, the easier it will be for you to find clients.
- So how do you find your niche?
- This is going to take a bit of research, and don't worry if it takes a few days.
- But basically, you need to answer those questions:
  - What Makes You Different and special?
  - What do you have to offer that no one else does?

#### Specialize and Choose a Target Audience

- Because let's face it, if you go on Google Maps and type in `web designers near me`, you will soon realize that they all offer the same thing roughly.
- Like "we build beautiful websites" or "professional websites," "we build responsive websites" (who doesn't?) or even "we compete on price" using words like "affordable" or "cheapest websites around."
- So let me tell you immediately, you're not gonna win any clients with that.
- So that means that your value proposition should be so targeted that you'll become the obvious choice in your niche.
- So for instance, you could specialize in
  **food ordering websites** for take care restaurant

or set up **appointment booking website** for service providers

- or even create an online store for local small businesses

or specialize in **Dynamic websites** specifically Dynamic content.

- And by doing so, you will become unique, and you will have a specific demographic that you can Target.

#### Ensure Your Target Audience is Large Enough

- Now, in line with that, make sure that your target audience is big enough.
- Obviously, you have a big enough pool.
- So let's say you want to specialize in appointment booking websites.
- Well, you're almost certain that there's enough businesses out there to contact like hairdressers, barber shops, accountants, lawyers, plumbers, electricians, etc.
- So clearly, this would be a viable idea.

#### Build Your Own Website

- The next step is to build your own website.
- This one is just common sense because no one is going to hire a web designer that does not have a website.
- First, you need to find a domain name that's memorable.
- So back to the idea of specializing in appointment booking websites, you could have, for instance, `fullybooked.com`.
- That's your catchy name, isn't it?
- But it might be taken already, so you might have to try different variations.
- Maybe `fully booked each day.com` or `fully booked each week.com` or choose even maybe a local name like in Ireland here with `DOT IE` extensions.
- And as it turns out, as you can see here, `fullybooked dot a` is available now.
- When designing your website, stick to the basics.
- Don't try to wow your visitors or your own website needs to be clean, well-structured, and professional.
- That's all.

#### Create a Demo Website

- Normally, every web designer uploads what is called a portfolio to showcase the latest websites they've built.
- Since you're only starting up, you don't have any clients yet, you can't showcase any portfolio.
- So instead of that, what can you do?
- Again, if you decide to specialize in food ordering websites for a restaurant, for instance, all you need to do is to build an actual demo website where people can test all those features.
- And of course, make sure that it is well-polished and runs smoothly.
- And once your demo site is ready on your own website, don't forget to add a big call to action button that says `demo site` or `see it in action`.

#### Set Your Price Structure

- The next step is to set your price structure.
- Have a set price for everything and don't hide those prices.
- Please display them broadly on your website.
- I promise you, no one likes to fill out the form that says `request a quote`.
- There's nothing more annoying than that.
- So if I personally go on the web designer's website, I want to see prices somewhere.
- Make it really easy, straight up in the menu section.
- Have a pricing Tab, and that's it.

#### Create a Presentation Video

- For the next step, I would highly recommend that you record a presentation video of your services.
- Show all the benefits, demonstrate how easy the platform is to use.
- So that way you won't have to repeat yourself, and you can let the video do all the talking for you 24/7.
- And the best part is that you can share it anywhere you want on your website, your social media platforms, your email signature, etc., etc.

#### Finding Clients

- Finally, now it's time for you to find clients.
- But you know what? We'll leave that for another video.
