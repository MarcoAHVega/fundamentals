# Why learn React?

### it is one of the most popular ui libraries

well the first reason is a practical one `it is one of the most popular ui libraries` and is well known in the job market, learn react and you could land that front-end developer job you've always wanted

second reason is that `react has a great community behind it`, you will be able to find tons of articles and stack overflow solutions to most of the problems that you will encounter when learning react

### the technical aspects of react and why it is a good choice

- `react has a component based architecture`

this lets you break down your application into small encapsulated parts which can then be composed to make more complex user interfaces

components also make it possible to write reusable code

for enterprise applications the ability to reuse code is a huge plus point

- `another key point is that react is declarative`

now what does that mean?

well basically you just have to tell react what you want through code and react with its react dom library will build the actual ui

react will abstract away the difficult parts and make it painless for you to create complex uis

the bottom line is that react will be a great addition to your skill set
