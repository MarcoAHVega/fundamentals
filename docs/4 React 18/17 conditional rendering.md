# Conditional rendering

### two common ways to conditionally render in react

  let's now move on to the next important
  topic which is two common ways to conditionally render in react

  when you're building react applications
  you may often need to show or hide some html based on a certain condition

  luckily conditional rendering in react works the same way conditions work in
  javascript

  let's look at two common ways to conditionally render in react

  - in the components folder i'm going to create a new file called
    UserGreeting.js

  within the file i'm going to create a
  simple component

  export const user greeting

  and within the component i'm going to define a new constant
  const isLoggedIn is equal to false

  for the jsx i'm going to add a message
  that says welcome

  ```js
  export const UserGreeting = () => {
    const isLoggedIn = false
    return <div>Welcome</div>
  }
  ```

  - now what i want is for the message to be conditionally rendered
    based on the value of isLoggedIn

  if i am logged in the message welcome vishwas should be displayed

  and if i am not logged in the message welcome guest
  should be displayed

### using the ternary operator

  the first way to achieve that is using the ternary operator

  so after welcome we add a pair of curly braces to evaluate the javascript expression

  the expression is to check if is logged in is true or false

  if it is true append vishwas

  else append guest

  let's save this file

  ```js
  export const UserGreeting = () => {
    const isLoggedIn = false
    return <div>Welcome {isLoggedIn ? 'Vishwas' : 'Guest'}</div>
  }
  ```

  include it in app component, so user greeting
  import it at the top

  ```js

  ```

  and head back to the browser
  you can see that the message welcome guest is displayed and that is because he's logged in is set to false

  change it to true

  ```js
  export const UserGreeting = () => {
    const isLoggedIn = true
    return <div>Welcome {isLoggedIn ? 'Vishwas' : 'Guest'}</div>
  }
  ```

  and the message welcome vishwas is
  displayed

### using the short circuit operator approach

  all right the final approach is `the short circuit operator approach`

  and this approach is just a specific case of the ternary operator approach

  when you want to render either something or nothing you make use of the short circuit operator

  for example right now we return either welcome vishwas or welcome guest based
  on the value of is logged in

  - now let's say if the user is logged in i want to display welcome vishwas and if the user is not logged in i want to render just welcome on the screen

  so based on is logged in render either
  welcome vishwas or nothing

  to do that, within curly braces we write is logged in ampersand ampersand
  vishwas

  ```js
  export const UserGreeting = () => {
    const isLoggedIn = true
    return <div>Welcome {isLoggedIn && 'Vishwas'}</div>
  }
  ```

  so what happens here is the expression evaluates the left hand side of the
  operator, is logged in

  if it is true it also evaluates the
  right hand side which in our case is jsx that will be rendered in the browser

  however if at all the left hand side evaluates to false the right hand side
  will never be evaluated as it doesn't affect the final value of the whole expression

  so if is logged in is set to true you can see in the browser welcome
  vishwas is displayed

  i change it to false

  ```js
  export const UserGreeting = () => {
    const isLoggedIn = false
    return <div>Welcome {isLoggedIn && 'Vishwas'}</div>
  }
  ```

  only welcome is displayed as you can see if you know javascript
  conditional rendering is pretty straightforward
