# 4. Designing in Figma with Auto Spacing in Auto Layouts

### Introduction

- Dan addresses the need for implementing auto spacing between icons within an auto layout.

- The current manual spacing approach leads to design issues when turning on or off icons.

### Auto Spacing Basics

- Dan explains the importance of switching to auto spacing for responsive design.

- He demonstrates how to change the spacing mode from "packed" to "auto" in the auto layout settings.

### Setting Auto Spacing

- Dan selects the auto layout container and adjusts the spacing.

- He shows how to manually set padding on both sides for consistent spacing.

### Shortcut for Setting Auto Spacing

- Dan mentions a quicker way to set auto spacing by double-clicking the spacing value and typing "auto."

- Alternatively, you can edit the spacing mode directly by replacing the number with "auto."

### Using Rounded Corners

- Dan explains that while it's unrelated to auto spacing, he's going to add rounded corners to the frame for a more realistic device look.

- He sets the border radius of the frame to 30 pixels for rounded corners.

### Additional Padding and Styling

- Dan increases the height of the frame and adds padding at the top for visual balance.

- He modifies the background color of the frame to create contrast with the icons.

- Dan adds a subtle drop shadow effect to distinguish the frame from the icons.

### Applying Styles to Multiple Frames

- Dan demonstrates how to copy the styling from one frame to another.

- He uses the shortcut (command/option + C) to copy the styling properties and (command/option + V) to paste them.

- Dan mentions the "Paste Properties" shortcut but highlights that manually clicking is equally efficient.

### Issues with Nested Components

- Dan notices that the copied styles didn't apply to the second frame because it's not a component.

- He introduces the concept of components within components and sets the stage for resolving this issue in the next video.

### Conclusion

- Dan concludes the video, acknowledging that the following segment will delve into handling components within components, providing a complete solution for the design.
