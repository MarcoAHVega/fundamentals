# Designing in Figma with Auto Spacing in Auto Layouts

- In this segment, we will focus on implementing automatic spacing between different icons.

- Currently, our spacing is manual, and we encounter issues when turning on additional icons.

- They don't reflow as expected, resulting in elements overflowing.

- However, with auto spacing, we can achieve a responsive design that adjusts seamlessly.

### Benefits of Auto Spacing

- Auto spacing ensures that elements reflow naturally when toggling different components.

- For instance, when we activate the "ticket" icon, the auto spacing feature allows everything to adjust harmoniously, maintaining consistent padding on the left and right.

- Responsive design becomes much more effective with auto spacing.

### Adding Rounded Corners and Styling

- Before we proceed further, we'll also make some stylistic enhancements.

- Towards the end of this segment, we'll add rounded corners, interface colors, and a subtle drop shadow to our auto layout.

- This allows us to create a more complete design and practice applying multiple tools together.

### Changing Spacing to Auto

- To switch the spacing to auto rather than using fixed values, follow these steps:

1. Select the auto layout element.
2. In the Auto Layout settings, click the three dots.
3. Change the spacing mode to "Auto" (instead of "Packed" or "Space Between").

- Alternatively, you can directly type "auto" in the spacing input field.

Remember, you can use the Alt or Option key while dragging to adjust both sides of the spacing simultaneously.

### Applying Rounded Corners

- Let's proceed with adding rounded corners to our frame.

- Rounded corners mimic the design of actual devices and provide a more authentic look.

- This can be achieved by adjusting the border radius.

- Additionally, we'll adjust the padding to maintain a pleasing composition.

### Interface Color and Drop Shadow

- To enhance the visual appeal, we'll modify the background color of the frame.

- By adding a slightly darker interface color, we create contrast and separation between different elements.

- Furthermore, we'll apply a subtle drop shadow effect to make the frame stand out more convincingly.

### Applying Styling to Both Frames

- After styling the first frame, we'll copy its properties and apply them to the second frame.

- If you're unsure about keyboard shortcuts, you can use Command or Control along with the forward slash to access common shortcuts.

### Components Inside Components

- A challenge arises when working with components nested within other components.

- This is a topic we'll delve into in the next video, exploring how to effectively manage components within complex designs.

Stay tuned for the next segment, where we'll tackle the intricacies of components within components and further advance our design skills.
