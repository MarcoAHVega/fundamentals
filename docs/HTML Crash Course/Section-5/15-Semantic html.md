# 15. Semantic html

### a semantic element clearly describes the meaning in a human and machine readable way

the next topic we're going to learn about is semantic html

and this is something that is given more care as you become familiar with html

when grouping elements or content in web page it is possible to use div and span tags

if you were to open a pretty old website you will see hundreds of div and span
tags

however these tags tell nothing about
their content

semantic html aims to fix this problem

a semantic element clearly describes the meaning in a human and machine readable way

- in html5 there are roughly a hundred semantic elements

for this crash course i want to highlight just a few frequently used elements

### typical layout for a web page

- here is a typical layout for a web page

### header

for the header you would use the `header` tag

### nav

for the navigation bar where you typically see links to home about services etc you use the `nav` tag

### section

you then have the `section` tag which defines a section of the page

for example an intro some contact info etc

### article

you also have the `article` tag which can be used for blog posts product cards user comments newspaper articles etc

### aside

the `aside` tag is used to define some content aside from the main content

for example a sidebar where you can highlight recent or featured blog posts

### footer

finally you have the `footer` for links in your web page like privacy policy
copyright info sitemap etc

- with semantic html the code suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated

and not just that semantic html helps search engines to influence the page
search rankings

and screen readers can use them as a sign post to help visually impaired
users navigate a page

semantic html is quite important from an
interview point of view as well so once you're comfortable with basic html elements make sure you get a good
grasp on semantic html elements

that pretty much wraps up everything we had to learn from a body tag point of view
