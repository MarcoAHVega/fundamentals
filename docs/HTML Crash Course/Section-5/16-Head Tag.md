### contains the title and metadata about the html document

for our final bit let's dive deeper into the head html element we discussed very
early in this video

the head of an html document is the part
that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded

### meta tag end metadata

the tag that is used to describe
metadata is the meta tag

initial scale

if you know about these meta tags you're
all set with the head section of an html document

### script and style tags
