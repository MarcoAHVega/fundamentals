# 3 what is html?

### html stands for

- `hyper text markup language`

  and is the language for creating web pages

  now the expansion itself isn't very important as everyone refers to it as just html

  but what is important is to keep in mind that `it is a markup language` and not a programming language

  so we simply mark certain things in the code we write which tells the browser how to structure the web page

  it `does not contain any logic` like conditionals or branching

  html consists of a series of elements and each element tells the browser how to display the content

  all we have to do is learn about these individual elements and we would have effectively learned html

### html file

first we need to create a file which will contain all our html code

such a file is called an html file and has the extension dot html

so click on the new file icon and create a file called `index.html`

now the file name can be hello dot html or test.html or any name of your liking but
`index.html is sort of the convention` and i would recommend you follow the same

within the file we can `type welcome to html` and save the file using control s
or command s on your keyboard

we can now go back to the html crash course folder which contains index.html

and simply double click on the file this will open the file in your default browser an you should be able to see the text welcome to html

as you can see you're now able to get some content on to the web browser
