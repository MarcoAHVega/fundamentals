# 2. Setup

to work with html we need two things

### browser and a code editor

- for browser you can use chrome firefox or even edge i am going to be using `chrome`

- to write the html code we need an editor i would recommend `visual studio code` it is probably the best editor out there

### the prettier extension

- we're going to install one extension which is helpful for formatting the code we write so in the sidebar open extensions and install the prettier extension

### the project folder

- I have created a folder called html crash course
