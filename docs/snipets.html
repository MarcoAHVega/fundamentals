we are slowly approaching the end of the course and in this final lesson we're going to take a look
how to deploy with application and the servers for the deployment that we are going to be using is
called GitHub pages in fact there are a lot more services which provide support for when it comes to
deployment and the deployment process is pretty simple for any of those services so we're going to
review deployment steps by using GitHub Pages as always I have already prepared default evid
application which we're going to deploy and actually before I get into the deployment we need to
make sure that our repository exists on GitHub which in my case it does so we can go directly to the
deployment we will not change any default configurations so after building our project all build
files will be located inside this folder and this is exactly the folder which is going to be
deployed so here in docs let's choose the option deployment moment to GitHub pages and our
repository URL corresponds to this format where we have two URL segments first one is our GitHub
username and the second one is the name of the repository so the only configuration option we have
to specify will be the option called base and this option should contain the name of our repository
so let's just go ahead and create configuration file vid.config.js in the root of this project from
here we're going to expert configuration object with only one option base where we're gonna specify
repository name which in my case is with Dash deployment and once again this is really important
that this option value should match repository name on GitHub so now we have to create new commit
where we're gonna include our configuration file let's specify an a message and push this commit to
GitHub after that let's just make sure that then you commit appears in the GitHub history of our
project it is this second commit then let's open up settings tab the main branch of our repository
is main so we're gonna deploy this branch and now on the left side let's open up page called pages
and in here we have to set up some deployment configurations firstly in this Source drop down we
have to choose option GitHub actions and then let's click this link create your own which is
basically going to create an empty deployment configuration file let's clear out all these
predefined content and specify our run configurations and these configurations are listed in with
Docs so we just have to copy over this whole configuration paste it in that file and let's quickly
go through some of the options specified in this file in here we can see which branch is going to be
deployed and down here there are a couple of steps which will be executed during deployment for
example in here we can see that the node version which is going to be used to build our project will
be version 18 then we're gonna install all npm dependencies by running npm install after that we're
gonna build a project by running npm run build and at the end once this folder with our build files
will be created this folder will be deployed to GitHub Pages server then let's just give this
configuration file a name for example deploy.yml and click commit changes in here let's make sure
that the new commit will be created on the main branch let's click commit changes once again and
then we can see another new commit in the commit history that's the commit with the configuration
file for deployment we have just created and then if we open up tap actions here we can actually see
the new deployment task that is currently running and this is our deployment task so anytime we're
gonna push changes to the main branch it will automatically kick off the deployment process and by
clicking on this task we can actually inspect what steps are executed during the deployment and once
this deployment will be successfully finished we can once again open up settings tab and then go to
Pages page and in here we will see the URL where our application will be available on the web so by
following this URL we can see that our replication was successfully deployed on GitHub pages and
that's it we were able to successfully deploy the duplication on GitHub Pages server as we can see
it was pretty simple process and if we decide to deploy our project by using another hosting
provider the deployment process is going to be pretty simple as well and with that we are finishing
this course about vidbundler
