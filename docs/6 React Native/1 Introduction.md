# Introduction

- Hey everyone, my name is Vishwas.

- Welcome to an exciting series on React Native for beginners.

### What is React Native?

- React Native is an open-source framework for building native Android and iOS applications using React.

- Leveraging JavaScript, you can access platform-specific APIs while employing React components to define the appearance and behavior of
  your user interface.

### Why Learn React Native?

- Traditionally, developing an iOS app requires knowledge of Swift or Objective-C, while building an Android app requires Java or Kotlin
  expertise.
- With React Native, you can create an app that works seamlessly on both platforms, saving time and effort.

- Learning React Native involves a minimal learning curve if you already have experience with React.

- React Native is in high demand in the job market, allowing businesses to have a single team proficient in React Native instead of
  separate iOS and Android developers.
- The expertise in React can also extend to web app development.

- React Native is used by companies like Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Pinterest, and Discord, making it a valuable addition to your skill set.

### Prerequisites for Learning React Native

- A solid understanding of JavaScript and the fundamentals of React is essential.

- Concepts like function components, props, state, JSX, and hooks are prerequisites.

- If you're new to React, don't worry. There is an extensive tutorial series covering React from beginner to advanced levels.
