# Expo vs React Native

- let's explore a vital topic: Expo versus React Native.

### React Native

- React Native is an open-source framework maintained by Meta or Facebook, designed for building cross-platform apps.

### Expo

- Expo, on the other hand, is an independent open-source framework maintained by Expo itself.

- While both frameworks have the common goal of developing Android and iOS apps, they differ significantly in terms of maintenance, ease of setup, and platform compatibility.

### Advantages of Expo

- Expo provides a streamlined experience and a suite of tools and services built around React Native, greatly simplifying the development process.

- Expo is to React Native what Mixtures is to React.

- It offers a simplified setup compared to plain React Native, which can be challenging and time-consuming.

- One of the key advantages of Expo is the ability to develop your app on Windows or Linux and still run it on a physical iPhone.

- Expo has evolved significantly over the years and now supports nearly all the features necessary for building enterprise mobile apps.

### Flexibility of Expo

- In the event that you require access to native Android or iOS code, Expo allows you to eject your app and work with a plain React Native code base.

- This flexibility ensures that you have the option to leverage the additional functionalities provided by Expo while still tapping into native code when necessary.

### Expo as the Default Choice

- If you're new to React Native and exploring the official React Native documentation, you'll notice that Expo is the default choice for setting up your development environment.

- This endorsement by the React Native community highlights Expo as the optimal starting point for beginners.

- Expo provides a smoother onboarding experience and a robust set of tools to kick-start your React Native journey, which is what we will be using in this series.

### Conclusion

- Join me in the next video where we will create our first React Native project using Expo. Thank you.
