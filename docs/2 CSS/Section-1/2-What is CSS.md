# 2. What is CSS?

### first let us understand what is css

- `css stands for cascading style sheets` and is the language used to style an
  html document

- css is a style sheet language and not a programming language

- with css you control the layout of a web page, the spacing between elements, what color the text should be in etc

- and the way you do that is `by selecting html elements and applying styles` to
  those selected elements

and this is pretty much all you have to learn from a beginner point of view

- how do i select an html element
- and what styles can i apply to that selected
  element

in answering these two questions you're effectively learning css
