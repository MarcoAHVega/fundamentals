## 34 Grid Basics & Columns

>

### we're gonna go over just The basics of how `the grid` works

and the `grid-template-columns` property

### Basics:

>

### The grid works in a similar way to flexbox

1.  let's go ahead and create our mark up

2.  let's style the items

3.  Then, we want to add display to the div container

4.  Now if I save that nothing happens, What we need to do is add (grid-template-columns:)

5.  Now even if we have more than 3 grid items here, That's absolutely fine

6.  let's say we wanted the middle one to stretch, We could use `auto`

7.  And let's say I wanted them all to be the same but I wanted them to fill the container

8.  Now there's a better way to do this, You can simply use `repeat()`

9.  Now we used pixels here, but the most common unit using the grid is a `fraction`

10. Now notice that these have no margin, there's a specific property, `grid-gap:`

11. What I want to show you now is just how easy it is to do a simple layout

## 35 Grid Rows

>

### Now there's also a `grid-template-rows` property

>

### we're also going to talk about the `implicit rows`

1.  for this we are going to need again a div with a class of grid,then we need to style the items

2.  So remember with Flexbox we have a row and a column, with the grid we also have rows and columns

3.  there's actually another property we can use `grid-auto-rows:`

### Now unlike flexbox the grid is multi-dimensional so we can we can use `grid-template-rows:` along with 'grid-template-columns:`

>

### So just to show you that let's set grid columns
