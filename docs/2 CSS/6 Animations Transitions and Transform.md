# ANIMATIONS

---

## 29 Keyframes Animation 1

>

### there's a few ways to do animations So let's get started with keyframes

>

### different properties

- `animation-name:`
- `animation-duration:`

### We have to create a @keyframes

- we can basically specify points in the animation
- `from {}`
- `to {}`

### animation-iteration-count:

- `animation-iteration-count: infinite;`
- `animation-fill-mode: forwards;`

### animation-delay:

>

### animation-direction: alternate-reverse;

>

### We also have animation-direction:

>

### animation-timing-function:

- `ease`
- `ease-in`
- `ease-out`
- `ease-in-out`

### animate the background-color

>

### animate the position

>

### short hand animation property

>

## 30 Keyframe Animation 2

>

### you can you can use percentages

>

### the starting point to end (0% to 100%)

- and then I'm going to say well at 25 percent I want it to be top zero.
- So let's go right under this and say it 50 percent of the base
- So next thing we want to do is add 75 percent

### So let's say at every point we want to change the Background-color

>

### We can also animate the border radius

>

### Let's do border radius

>

### So you should be able to come up with some nice ideas as far as animation goes

>

### **Practice 30**

## 31 CSS Transitions

>

### transition-property:

- `transition-property: background;`
- `transition-duration: 2s;`

### to add a hover event

- `transition-delay: 3s;`
- `transition-timing-function: ease-in;`

### the transition property shorthand (transition: background 2s ease-in-out;)

- the transition property (background)
- duration
- timing function
- if we wanted to delay we could add that on here as well But I don't want to delay

### border-radius (other things that we can add that we can transition.)

>

### all the transitional properties

>

### **Practice 31**

## 32 Transform Property

### transform: rotate();

>

### transform: skew();

>

### transform: scale(2);

>

### use transform: scale(); with transitions
