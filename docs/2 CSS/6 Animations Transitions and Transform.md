# Animations Transitions and Transform

---

<h2>29 Keyframes Animation 1</h2>

<h3>1. there's a few ways to do animations So let's get started with keyframes</h3>

<h3>2. different properties</h3>

- `animation-name:`
- `animation-duration:`

<h3>3. We have to create a @keyframes</h3>

- we can basically specify points in the animation
- `from {}`
- `to {}`

<h3>4. animation-iteration-count:</h3>

- `animation-iteration-count: infinite;`
- `animation-fill-mode: forwards;`

<h3>5. animation-delay:</h3>

<h3>6. animation-direction: alternate-reverse;</h3>

<h3>7. We also have animation-direction:</h3>

<h3>8. animation-timing-function:</h3>

- `ease`
- `ease-in`
- `ease-out`
- `ease-in-out`

<h3>9. animate the background-color</h3>

<h3>10. animate the position</h3>

<h3>11. short hand animation property</h3>

<h2>30 Keyframe Animation 2</h2>

<h3>1. you can you can use percentages</h3>

<h3>2. the starting point to end (0% to 100%)</h3>

- and then I'm going to say well at 25 percent I want it to be top zero.
- So let's go right under this and say it 50 percent of the base
- So next thing we want to do is add 75 percent

<h3>3. So let's say at every point we want to change the Background-color</h3>

<h3>4. We can also animate the border radius</h3>

<h3>5. Let's do border radius</h3>

<h3>6. So you should be able to come up with some nice ideas as far as animation goes</h3>

<h2>31 CSS Transitions</h2>

<h3>1. transition-property:</h3>

- `transition-property: background;`
- `transition-duration: 2s;`

<h3>2. to add a hover event</h3>

- `transition-delay: 3s;`
- `transition-timing-function: ease-in;`

<h3>3. the transition property shorthand (transition: background 2s ease-in-out;)</h3>

- the transition property (background)
- duration
- timing function
- if we wanted to delay we could add that on here as well But I don't want to delay

<h3>4. border-radius (other things that we can add that we can transition.)</h3>

<h3>5. all the transitional properties</h3>

<h2>32 Transform Property</h2>

<h3>1. transform: rotate();</h3>

<h3>2. transform: skew();</h3>

<h3>6. use transform: scale(); with transitions</h3>
