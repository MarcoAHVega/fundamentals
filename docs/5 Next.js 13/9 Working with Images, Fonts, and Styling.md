# Working with Images, Fonts, and Styling Your App

### Overview

So far, we've learned about building a brand new Next.js app.

We've learned how to set up the basic pages, layout, and routing between the pages in our Next.js app.

In this module, we'll dive into the Font component in Next.js, styling your Next.js app, and adding images using the Image component.

We'll also learn about how the Image component that comes with Next.js is highly optimized. Let's get started.

### add images and css needed for this part

You'll notice a few new files here. Ensure that you use the `module 4 before` exercises folder from Pluralsight while getting set up on this module.

It contains some images within this image folder and additional CSS files, which we'll get to later in this module.

- create an `images folder` within the root folder and add `all images` in it.

- create a `styles folder` and the `global.css` and the and the `Home.module.css` files.
