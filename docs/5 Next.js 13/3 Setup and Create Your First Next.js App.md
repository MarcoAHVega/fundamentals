# Setup and Create Your First Next.js App

### Overview

In this module, you'll learn hands on about setting up and creating your first Next.js app. You'll first be introduced to the demo Globomantics app that you're going to build in this course. Then, you'll:

- Create and set up the Next.js app.
- Learn about pages and layout in Next.js
- Configure the basic pages and layout for the demo application
- Learn how to link and navigate between these pages

By the end of this module, your Next.js demo application is set up and ready for more features. Let's get started.

### Globomantics Conference App

Throughout this course, we're going to be building a website for the fictional company, Globomantics, for demo purposes using Next.js.

### What is Globomantics?

Globomantics is a software company, and they also host annual tech conferences. In this course, we're going to build their website using React and Next.js.

### Features of the Globomantics Web App

The web app will contain the following features:

- Conference pages, which display the conference sessions and the speaker information.

- All of this is going to be built using React, and it'll be bootstrapped with Next.js.

### Goal

Our goal is to create this Globomantics web app from scratch using Next.js and also learn all of its features along the way.
Are you ready to get started?

### Setup Next.js Demo App

In this clip, we will set up the Next.js demo application within our local environment.

### System Requirements

Before we begin, let's review the system requirements to install Next.js:

- Ensure that you're using Node.js version 14.6.0 or newer.
- Next.js is supported on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Demo App Setup

Our demo app, Globomantics, is already set up with Next.js, and you'll simply have to:

- Download the exercise folder for this module and run the installation steps
- Or clone the app from the GitHub repo shown here and run the installation steps.

```
git clone https://github.com/adhithiravi/Next.js-Fundamentals
```

### Installation Steps

To install the dependencies, simply open the project on VS Code and run yarn. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server with the yarn dev command. You can also use npm to install dependencies and run the dev server with npm if you prefer.

### Create Your Own Next.js App

Alternatively, if you want to create your own Next.js app from scratch, then you can simply use the create next-app command, which sets up everything automatically for you. You can use npx create-next-app and pass the latest flag, which will install the latest version of Next.js. You can use yarn or pnpm and run the create next-app command as well.

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```
