# What are design patterns?

- Design patterns are effective solutions to common application development challenges.

- They provide the most efficient and maintainable solutions to these challenges.

- Design patterns are the positive equivalent of anti-patterns, which are ineffective solutions leading to brittle code and decreased performance.

### Types of design patterns covered in this course:

- The design patterns discussed in this course are not the traditional object-oriented programming design patterns (such as creational and behavioral patterns).

- These patterns are specific to React applications and have been encountered repeatedly in real-world scenarios.

- Some of the common challenges addressed in this course include:

  - Creating reusable layouts for components (e.g., split screens, modals).

  - Reusing complex logic between components.

  - Working with forms in React.

  - Incorporating concepts from functional programming into React apps.
