# Creating Small Product List Item Component

- Create a new file called "smallProductListItem.js"

- Inside the file, create a functional component called "SmallProductListItem" that takes in a single prop called "product"

- In the component, destructure the "name" and "price" properties from the "product" prop

- Display the "name" and "price" properties in an H3 heading with a dash in between them

### Creating Large Product List Item Component

- Create a new file called "largeProductListItem.js"

- Inside the file, create a functional component called "LargeProductListItem" that takes in a single prop called "product"

- In the component, destructure the "name", "price", "description", and "rating" properties from the "product" prop

- Wrap all of the content in a React fragment

- Display the "name" property in an H3 heading

- Display the "price" property in a paragraph tag

- Display the "description" property in an H3 heading

- Display the "rating" property in a paragraph tag

### Creating a Numbered List Component

- Create a new file called "numberedList.js"

- Inside the file, create a functional component called "NumberedList" that takes in three props: "items", "resourceName", and "itemComponent"

- Inside the component, use a map function to iterate over the "items" array and display each item with a number next to it

- Wrap the "itemComponent" in a React fragment and display the number of each item with an H3 heading

### Displaying Product List Items with Regular and Numbered Lists

- To display the small product list item, import the "SmallProductListItem" component and pass it as the "itemComponent" prop to the "RegularList" or "NumberedList" component

- To display the large product list item, import the "LargeProductListItem" component and pass it as the "itemComponent" prop to the "RegularList" or "NumberedList" component

- To display the product list with a regular list, use the "RegularList" component and pass in the "items" array, "product" as the "resourceName" prop, and either "SmallProductListItem" or "LargeProductListItem" as the "itemComponent" prop

- To display the product list with a numbered list, use the "NumberedList" component and pass in the same props as above

### Benefits of Using Component Combinations

- By creating just six different components, we were able to create eight different combinations of list items and list types

- This allows for a lot of flexibility in our app without having to create a lot of extra components

- As our app grows, this can save us a lot of time and effort in development
