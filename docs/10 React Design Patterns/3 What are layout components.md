# What are layout components?

- Layout components in React are components whose primary purpose is to arrange other components on the page.

- Examples of layout components include split screens, lists, and modals.

- The basic idea of layout components is to separate the layout styles from the component itself.

- By creating separate layout components, we gain more flexibility in how we use and display the components on the page.

- The main concept of layout components is that the main content components should not be aware of or concerned with their actual placement on the page.

### Examples of layout components:

- Side navigation component: A component that displays a bar on the left-hand side containing links.

- Split screen component: A component that arranges multiple components in different sections of the page.

- List component: A component that displays data in a list format.

- Modal component: A component that displays content over the actual page.
