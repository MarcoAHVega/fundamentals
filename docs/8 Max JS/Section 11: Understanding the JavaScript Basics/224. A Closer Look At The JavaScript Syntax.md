# - A Closer Look At The JavaScript Syntax

>

### General Syntax

- You've learned about some important syntax features and rules already.

- For example, there must be a `white space` after `let` .

- `let` is a special keyword in JavaScript used to create a variable.

- We can store a value in a variable using `the equal sign.`

- Variable names must not contain blanks or special characters.

- The convention is to use `camelCase` for variable names.

### Rules vs Conventions

- It's a rule to not have blanks in variable names.

- It's a convention to use camelCase notation for variable names.

- Following the convention is not mandatory, but it is recommended.

- For example, using "Greeting" with a capital G is valid but against the convention.

### Line Endings

- Lines in JavaScript code often end with a semi-colon.

- It's not mandatory, but it's commonly done to mark the end of a line.

- Without a semi-colon, multiple commands in one line would cause an error.

- It's considered good practice to split instructions across multiple lines and omit semi-colons.

- However, using semi-colons after every line is still seen in code and can be a personal programming style choice.

### Consistency

- Be consistent with the use of semi-colons and quotes.

- While not required, using semi-colons at the end of each line is a common practice.

- Once a decision is made, stick to it throughout the code.
