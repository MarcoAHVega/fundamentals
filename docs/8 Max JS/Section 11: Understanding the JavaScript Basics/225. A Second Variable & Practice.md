# - A Second Variable & Practice

- Now that we covered some important basics about variables, I want you to practice what we learnt up to this point.

### Practice Task

1.  Take the number 32 and store it in a variable instead of using it directly in the code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
    <script>
      let greetingText = "Hi, I'm Max!!!!"
      alert(greetingText)
      alert(greetingText)
      greetingText = 'Hi, I am really Max!'
      alert(32)
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

- Store it in a variable at the beginning of our script and use that variable down below.
- Additionally, use two alerts that work with that variable to make it more useful.
- The value 32 could represent an age, so choose a proper variable name.

### Solution

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
    <script>
      let greetingText = "Hi, I'm Max!!!!"
      let userAge = 32
      alert(greetingText)
      alert(greetingText)
      greetingText = 'Hi, I am really Max!'
      alert('What is the user age?')
      alert(userAge)
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

- So, did you succeed? Let's do this together.

### Creating a Second Variable

1. We want to create a second variable. You can add variables anywhere in your script, but we'll add it at the beginning.

- Add the variable right at the top.

2. We can now add a new variable with the `let` keyword.

- Choose a name for the variable. The name depends on what the value represents. We'll assume it represents an age.

3. Name the variable `age` .

- Unlike `greetingText` , the variable `age` does not have any capital characters because it's not necessary.

4. Store the value 32 in the variable.

- Add a semicolon after the assignment, following the style used in this course.

5. Now that the variable is created, we can use it.

- Use the variable in the `alert` function to output the value of `age` .

6. We can also output multiple alerts for `age` .

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
    <script>
      let age = 32
      let greetingText = "Hi, I'm Max!!!!"
      alert(greetingText)
      alert(greetingText)
      greetingText = 'Hi, I am really Max!'
      alert(age)
      alert(age)
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

- If you save and reload the page, you will see the greetings and the value of `age` being output.
