# - Accessing Object Properties

### For objects, accessing properties is similar to arrays.

- To output a specific property, use the variable name followed by a dot.

- This dot syntax allows us to access different properties of an object.

### Dot notation

- In JavaScript, dot notation is a syntax used to access properties and methods of objects. It allows you to retrieve or modify specific values within an object.

- Dot notation is a fundamental concept in JavaScript, allowing you to interact with objects and access their properties and methods easily.

### IDEs like Visual Studio Code provide auto-completion for object properties.

- Suggestions are displayed with a blue box indicating the actual properties.

- Select the desired property from the dropdown and use it in your code.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
  title: 'developer',
  place: 'New York',
  salary: 50000,
}
alert(hobbies[0])
alert(job.title)
```

- The above code will display the first hobby ('Sports') and then the job title ('developer').

- Objects are an important value type in JavaScript and are frequently used in code.
