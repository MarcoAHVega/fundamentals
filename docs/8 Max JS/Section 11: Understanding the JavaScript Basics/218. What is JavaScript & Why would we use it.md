# - What is JavaScript & Why would we use it?

### Introduction to JavaScript

- JavaScript is the third language that web developers need to know.

- It is a programming language used for writing code that is executed by browsers.

### JavaScript's Role

- JavaScript is responsible for adding interactivity and changing the page after it is loaded.

- Unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript can solve different problems and add functionality to websites.

### Why do we need JavaScript?

- HTML and CSS define content, structure, and styling, while JavaScript adds interactivity.

- JavaScript allows us to dynamically change the page and add interactive features.

### Example of JavaScript in Action

- JavaScript code can update the content and structure of a webpage based on user input.

- It can count characters, display warnings, and change colors in real-time.

- JavaScript can fetch data, update information, set timers, validate user input, manage overlays, reorder or hide elements, and keep websites running even without an internet connection.

- Throughout the course, we will explore these examples and many more to understand the power of JavaScript.
