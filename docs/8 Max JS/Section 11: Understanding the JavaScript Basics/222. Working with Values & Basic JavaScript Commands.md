# - Working with Values & Basic JavaScript Commands

### Different Values in JavaScript

- We have learned that there are different values in JavaScript, such as `strings` and `numbers` . Let's start with these values.

### String Value

- A `string value` is created in JavaScript code using either double quotes or single quotes.

- These quotes act as delimiters to JavaScript and to the browser. They indicate where our text starts and ends.

- It is important to be consistent in the use of quotes. If you prefer double quotes, use them throughout your JavaScript code, and don't switch between double and single quotes.

### String Value Example

- Here is an example of a string value: `'Hi my name is Max!'`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
    <script>
      'Hi my name is Max!'
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

### To escape a character

- Note that if you want to use a single quote within the text and you're using single quotes to delimit the text, you have to escape that character with a backward slash.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
    <script>
      'Hi, I\'m Max!'
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

- This is a special syntax worth knowing when working with strings. It allows you to add the quote character inside of a string.

### Creating a Number

- We can also `create a number` by simply entering a number without quotes around it. For example, we can add 32 as a number.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
    <script>
      'Hi, I\'m Max!'
      32
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

### What Can We Do With These Values?

- At this point, you might be wondering what we can do with these values. For starters, we can output them. One way of doing this is by using the `alert function` .

### Alert Function

- The `alert function` is a built-in instruction that the browser understands. It tells the browser to display a certain alert overlay on the screen with the specified text.

- For example, if we write `alert("Hi, I'm Max!")`, the browser will display an alert with the message "Hi, I'm Max!".

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
    <script>
      alert("Hi, I'm Max!")
      32
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

- Similarly, we can use the alert function to display a number. For example, `alert(32)` will display an alert with the number 32.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>JavaScript Introduction</title>
    <script>
      alert("Hi, I'm Max!")
      alert(32)
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

### Other Uses of JavaScript

- Besides showing alerts, there are many other things we can do with JavaScript. For example, we can send requests to a server, set timers, and manipulate the HTML code visible on the page. We will explore these features step-by-step.

- What's missing from this discussion are variables, which we will cover next.
