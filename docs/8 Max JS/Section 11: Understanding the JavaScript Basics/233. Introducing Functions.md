# - Introducing Functions

- Functions are a key feature of programming, not just of JavaScript. Functions are basically our own commands, which we can define as a developer to then execute them anywhere in our code.

### Creating a Custom Function

- To create a custom function, you can add a new function by typing the function keyword.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
title: 'developer',
place: 'New York',
salary: 50000,
}
function
let adultYears = age - 18
alert(adultYears)
age = 45
adultYears = age - 18
alert(adultYears)
```

- Function names should not describe what's in them, but instead, what this operation does.

- Function names should describe as operation.

### Naming the Function

- So here, I wanna calculate my adult years and hence I'll name this function calculateAdultYears.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
title: 'developer',
place: 'New York',
salary: 50000,
}
function calculateAdultYears
let adultYears = age - 18
alert(adultYears)
age = 45
adultYears = age - 18
alert(adultYears)
```

- We don't use the equal sign as we did it for a variables, instead, for functions, we now add opening and closing parentheses, and then, curly braces, opening and closing curly braces.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
  title: 'developer',
  place: 'New York',
  salary: 50000,
}
function calculateAdultYears() {}
let adultYears = age - 18
alert(adultYears)
age = 45
adultYears = age - 18
alert(adultYears)
```

### Adding Code to the Function

And now, between those curly braces, we put our operation code, so the code that makes up this operation.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
  title: 'developer',
  place: 'New York',
  salary: 50000,
}
let adultYears
function calculateAdultYears() {
  adultYears = age - 18
}
let adultYears = age - 18
alert(adultYears)
age = 45
adultYears = age - 18
alert(adultYears)
```

### Storing the Function Result

We could store this in adultYears, however, not by using let here, but without let, and actually define this adult years variable before we define this function.

### Executing the Function

To execute a function, you repeat its name, so calculateAdultYears in my case, and then you add parentheses, opening and closing thereafter.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
  title: 'developer',
  place: 'New York',
  salary: 50000,
}
let adultYears
function calculateAdultYears() {
  adultYears = age - 18
}
calculateAdultYears()
alert(adultYears)
age = 45
adultYears = age - 18
alert(adultYears)
```

### Reusing the Function

We can also calculate adult years here instead of that operation, which we had before.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
  title: 'developer',
  place: 'New York',
  salary: 50000,
}
let adultYears
function calculateAdultYears() {
  adultYears = age - 18
}
calculateAdultYears()
alert(adultYears)
age = 45
calculateAdultYears()
alert(adultYears)
```

- The advantage of this is that we only have this operation once in our function, and then we just called this function into different places where we wanna perform this operation.

- Functions allow us to define code, which is not executed immediately, but which we instead trigger in different parts of our code when we need that code to run.
