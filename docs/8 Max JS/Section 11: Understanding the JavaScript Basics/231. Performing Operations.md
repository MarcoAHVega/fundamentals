# - Performing Operations

### Performing Operations with JavaScript Values

- Numbers, strings, arrays, and objects are important types of values frequently used in JavaScript programming.

- Often, you will need to perform calculations or transformations on these data types.

### Working with Values in JavaScript

- To perform operations on these values, we can use various JavaScript operators.

- For example, we can derive how many years a user has been an adult by subtracting 18 from their age.

### Creating a Variable to Store Calculation Results

- We can create a new variable, such as `adultYears` , to store the result of our calculation.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
title: 'developer',
place: 'New York',
salary: 50000,
}
let adultYears =
```

- The variable name should convey the meaning of the value it stores.

- In this case, `adultYears` will store the number of years the user has been an adult.

### Performing Calculations Dynamically

- Instead of hardcoding values, we can perform calculations dynamically.

- For example, we can subtract 18 from the `age` variable to calculate `adultYears` .

- JavaScript supports all basic math operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Displaying the Result of the Calculation

- We can use the `alert` function to display the result of our calculation.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
  title: 'developer',
  place: 'New York',
  salary: 50000,
}
let adultYears = age - 18

alert(adultYears)
```

### Working with Variables in JavaScript

- Variables are used to store values that can be used and manipulated in your code.

- The values stored in variables can change, hence the name "variable".

- You can reassign values to variables as needed.

### Reassigning Values to Variables

- If a variable's value changes, you can reassign the variable to the new value.

- When reassigning a value, do not use the `let` keyword again.

- The `let` keyword is only used when first creating the variable.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
  title: 'developer',
  place: 'New York',
  salary: 50000,
}

age = 45
let adultYears = age - 18
alert(adultYears)
```

### Order of Operations in JavaScript

- JavaScript executes instructions step by step, line by line.

- Therefore, if a variable's value changes before it is used in a calculation, the new value will be used, not the old value.

### Exploring JavaScript Features

- Playing around with different features of JavaScript can help you understand what you can do with the language.
