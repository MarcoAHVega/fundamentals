# 4. The html elements

### the building blocks

html isn't just writing text it is about marking that text to appear in a different way

and we do that by writing an html element

an html element is `the building block` of an html document

usually it has what is called an `opening tag` a `closing tag` and the `content` in between

a closing tag will contain the forward slash before the tag name whereas the opening tag does not

### nesting html elements

- it is also possible to contain one element as content of another element

so nesting of html elements is possible and is necessary when building any practical web page
