# 6. Text formatting

headings, paragraphs and more

### Headings

users looking at a web page tend to scan quickly to find relevant content
often just reading the headings before designing whether to read the corresponding paragraph of text or not

so html gives us heading and paragraph elements for some basic structuring of
the text

let's go over heading elements first

- html headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a web page

- there are six heading elements in total

### the h1 tag

the first one is the h1 element

so we specify the opening h1 tag the closing h1 tag

and the content in between let's type heading 1

```html
<body>
  <!-- Headings and Paragraph -->
  <h1>Hading 1</h1>
</body>
```

if you now head back to the browser and refresh
you can see we have the text in larger font size and it's also bold

- the h1 tag corresponds to the title of your web page

- and it's a good practice to have only one h1 tag per page

### the h2 tag

which brings us to the h2 tag

back in the editor i'm going to make a copy of this tag

shift alt down arrow being the shortcut and change each one to h2

and the content to heading two

```html
<body>
  <!-- Headings and Paragraph -->
  <h1>Hading 1</h1>
  <h2>Hading 2</h2>
</body>
```

save and take a look at the browser

you can see we have the h2 text

- and this is usually used for subheadings

### h3 to h6

if your web page needs more hierarchy in the content you can rely on the remaining heading
tags

i'm going to press alt shift or option shift and down arrow
to make copies of the h2 tag once twice
three times and four times

now change the tags to h3
all the way till h6

change the content as well

```html
<body>
  <!-- Headings and Paragraph -->
  <h1>Hading 1</h1>
  <h2>Hading 2</h2>
  <h3>Hading 3</h3>
  <h4>Hading 4</h4>
  <h5>Hading 5</h5>
  <h6>Hading 6</h6>
</body>
```

if you now save the file and take a look at the browser refresh

you can see the heading text being formatted in different ways

and this seems a bit large because i
have zoomed in let me reset and you can see the actual size of h1 to
h6 tags

they all are formatted differently

each heading starts in a new line and also has some spacing at the bottom
to separate from the content below

so we have marked the content
using tags to let the browser know how to display the content

this is pretty much what we do with html hopefully you're starting to get the
hang of it

### the paragraph element

another html element that is used for
displaying text is the paragraph element

add an opening tag
which is p and the closing tag

for the content i'm going to add this is
a paragraph

```html
<body>
  <!-- Headings and Paragraph -->
  <p>This id a paragraph</p>
</body>
```

take a look at the browser
and you see the paragraph text being displayed

- a paragraph text always starts on a new line and unlike headings it is usually a block of text

so text you see in a blog post product descriptions on your ecommerce sites etc

### lorem ipsum

to add more content to display in a paragraph add a new p tag
and for the content type lorem l-o-r-e-m and press tab

format it and you can see when we tab
it fills in a paragraph of text without you having to type it all out

let's make a copy of this save the file refresh

```html
<body>
  <!-- Headings and Paragraph -->
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consectetur autem unde sed.
    Doloremque, quae quo doloribus quia ipsum sapiente officiis repellat tenetur eligendi molestiae
    dolores in odio laudantium ipsa praesentium?
  </p>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Deserunt ex dolores, doloribus
    blanditiis distinctio beatae aperiam repudiandae velit laborum eligendi dolore asperiores
    voluptatum magni officiis incidunt ad sit optio! In?
  </p>
</body>
```

and you can see that each paragraph starts on a new line and adds a little
spacing to the content below

### white space is ignore by the browser

and what you do have to learn here is
that you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in
your html code

the browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page
is being displayed

so even if you split this paragraph into
separate lines the output will remain the same

### the line brake element

if you intentionally want to add line breaks html provides a line break element which
you can use

so after a line we can add
the break tag copy and paste it

```html
<body>
  <!-- Headings and Paragraph -->
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consectetur autem unde sed.
    Doloremque, quae quo doloribus quia ipsum sapiente officiis repellat tenetur eligendi molestiae
    dolores in odio laudantium ipsa praesentium?
  </p>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Deserunt ex dolores, doloribus
    <br />
    blanditiis distinctio beatae aperiam repudiandae velit laborum eligendi dolore asperiores
    <br />
    voluptatum magni officiis incidunt ad sit optio! In?
  </p>
</body>
```

### self-closing elements

now the break tag is sort of a special tag in the sense that

- you're allowed to skip the closing tag as there is no content

so just angle brackets

and even this forward slash is optional
the prettier formatter we are using does add the forward slash

so when you format the document
you're going to see this self-closing break tag

if we save the file refresh
you can see that our last paragraph is now split across three lines

first line then html encounters a break tag

so second line
a break tag again

and then the third line

### horizontal rule element

now while we're on this topic of
separation of content and self-closing tags

another noteworthy element is the
horizontal rule

the tag is hr

which is again self closing

i've added an hr tag in between the
paragraph elements

```html
<body>
  <p>This is a paragraph</p>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Consectetur autem unde sed.
    Doloremque, quae quo doloribus quia ipsum sapiente officiis repellat tenetur eligendi molestiae
    dolores in odio laudantium ipsa praesentium?
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Deserunt ex dolores, doloribus
    <br />
    blanditiis distinctio beatae aperiam repudiandae velit laborum eligendi dolore asperiores
    <br />
    voluptatum magni officiis incidunt ad sit optio! In?
  </p>
</body>
```

if i refresh the browser

you can see a horizontal rule is drawn across the page and separates the two
paragraphs

generally spacing is sufficient to separate two paragraphs

but it is worth knowing about the horizontal rule as well next
