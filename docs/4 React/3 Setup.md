# Setting up our development environment

### for react we need three things, a browser, node.js and a code editor.

for browser i am going to be using `chrome`

for node.js head over to nodejs.org you will need to download and install `the latest stable release`

to write code i am going to be using `vscode`

and make sure to `install the prettier extension` which will help with formatting

i have created `a folder` called `react 18 crash course` and i've opened vs code inside the folder
