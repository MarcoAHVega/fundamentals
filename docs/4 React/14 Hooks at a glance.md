# Hooks at a glance

### a hook is a special function that lets you hook into react features

now before we proceed i want to take a minute to explain the word hooks, it is something that you will hear a lot in react so i want to make sure you're familiar with what it is

a hook is a special function that lets you hook into react features

- for example useState is a hook that lets you add react state to function components

similarly there are other hooks that let you hook into other features

You have:

- `useReducer`, for more complex state management,

- `useEffect`

- `useContext`

- `useRef`

- `useMemo`

- `useCallback`

and the more recent additions to react 18 namely

- `useTransition`

and

- `useDeferredValue`

as a beginner not every hook is important in this fundamentals crash course apart from `useState`, we will later on look at `useEffect` and `useTransition`

as for the remaining hooks they are slightly more advanced so i will point you to the right resource at the end of this video
