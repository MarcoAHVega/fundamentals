# What is react?

### react is an open source javascript library for building user interfaces

there are two key points in this definition

the first one is that react is a javascript library, it is not a framework it is a library

it is focused on doing one thing and doing that one thing really well
and that is the second part building user interfaces

so react does not focus on the other aspects of your application like routing or http requests it is responsible only for building rich user interfaces

however there is no need to worry as react has a rich ecosystem and plays really well with other libraries and is more than capable of building enterprise scale web applications
