# What is a component?

### in react a component represents a part of the user interface

for example a traditional website can be broken down into header site nav main content and footer

each section is represented by a component in react

- `composition`

all the components when composed in the right way make up the entire website

- `Root (App) component`

we also have a component that contains all the four components it is called as root component and is usually named as app component

- `components are also reusable`

the same component can be used with different properties to display different information

for example the site nav component can be the left side nav as well as the right side nav

the ui can remain the same but the content can change

### component code

- `now how does a component translate to code in our application?`

a component code is usually placed in a javascript file

for example AppComponent is placed in App.js

all right so a component is basically the code inside a dot js file
but

- `what does that code look like?`

that depends on the type of the component

we have two types function components and class components
