# Further learning

with that we come to the end of this crash course on the fundamentals of
react

from here i would like to suggest the next steps that you can take to continue
down the react path

- first go through my video on the react
  roadmap for 2022

this will give you a big picture of react and its ecosystem

- after that start with my react playlist

it covers pretty much every concept you
need to know about react class components the advanced concepts

advanced hooks how react components re-render

the optimization techniques
and how to use react with typescript

- you can then start on some libraries

that help build large scale react apps

react query for all api requests
material ui chakra ui or mantine to work with readily available ui components

formic or react hook form for complex form management

and finally nexgs which is a react framework for production

over the past few years i've tried my best to make this channel a one-stop shop for everything related to react
so you will find a lot more playlists on libraries that i haven't mentioned as well for example react router browse
through the channel and learn something that is of interest to you i guarantee you'll not regret it
if you have enjoyed the video please do leave a like and subscribe to the channel for more content on web development
