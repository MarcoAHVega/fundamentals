# Section 1: Introduction and Setup

## 1. Introduction

### Introduction and Course Overview

- First, I want to thank you.

- You could have clicked on any video, but you chose mine, and I appreciate that.

- So thank you for the opportunity.

- You won't regret it.

### Welcome to My JavaScript Course

- With that being said, welcome to my JavaScript course.

- In this course, you will learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript the way the professionals use it.

- I'll be teaching you modern concepts and help you get up to speed fast.

### Succeeding in This Course

- I want to talk about how to succeed in this course when going through the videos.

- I want you to fully understand the concepts in the video before moving on.

- Even if you have to watch the video a second time, learning to program is more like learning another language.

- We are literally learning computer language.

- So take your time and enjoy the journey.

- This is not a race to the finish.

### Recommended Learning Approach

- I believe the best way to go about completing this course is to focus on one session per week.

- This gives you enough time to digest the information and build long-term memory.

- I know too many people speak through courses thinking that they'll get all of the information stored when in reality, they end up craving more than half of it.

- I should know because I went down that path when I first started learning programming.

### Target Audience and Value of the Course

- With that being said, this course is for those who have zero experience programming and for those who want to sharpen their skills coming out of a bootcamp.

- There is value for both.

- This course is also for people looking for job interview preparation because I go over concepts that I've personally asked and have seen asked in interviews.

### Advice for Effective Learning

- A quick piece of advice before I dive into the content.

- It will help to physically write down the code before writing it on your computer.

- The act of writing something down is very powerful.

- Not only are you forced to listen to the video, but you're also forced to write code on paper.

- You won't have help from the cheat sheet available in a text editor, and you won't have the text editor to tell you when you've made a mistake.

- This process helps build attention to detail, and coding needs a lot of attention to detail.

### Conclusion

- Now I'll let you go.

- Please enjoy the course.

## 2. Software Setup: Visual Studio Code

### Software Requirement

- The only piece of software that you'll need for this course is VScode or Visual Studio Code.

### Downloading Visual Studio Code

- I want you to navigate to call our visual studio icon.

- Then hit the download button after you press the download button.

- You'll see the download start towards the bottom.

### Conclusion

- I'll see you in the next video.
