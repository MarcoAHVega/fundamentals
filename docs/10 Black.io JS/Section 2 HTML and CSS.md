# Section 2: HTML and CSS

## 3. HTML introduction

### Introduction to HTML

- HTML is the foundation of a website instead of using brick, wood, and cement.

### Understanding HTML Tags

- We use tags in HTML.
- The tags are what built this structure and where the tags are placed.
- It defines the layout of the website.

### Visualizing HTML Structure

- I want you to take a look at this image.
- Really, take it in when you build an HTML.
- This is what I want you to think of.

### Getting Started with HTML

- OK, let's start writing HTML.

## 4. Setting Up VScode and Creating a New Folder

- The very first thing I want you to do is open up the VScode in a new window.
- Then click this icon here and select Open Folder.
- Navigate to a place on your desktop where you want to save your code and then click the new folder.
- I'm going to name my folder "app one".
- Press open.
- And this is the "app one" folder.
- I want you to press this new file icon here.
- Name this file "index.html".
- "index.html" is the standard name for an HTML file, so you'll see this a lot.

### Understanding HTML Tags

- So how do HTML tags look?
- We discussed how tags were the building blocks of HTML, but let's actually write them.
- This is the format of the tag, every HTML element will look almost exactly like this.
- You write it with an opening caret, the tag name, a closing caret, opening caret for a slash tag name, and then closing caret.
- I know this is a lot of stuff to remember, but this code allows us to autocomplete this whole process.
- All you have to do is write the opening caret, write the tag name, and then write the closing caret, and the rest of it is populated for you.
- That's the power of code.

### Starting to Use HTML Tags

- Now that we know how tags look, we will start using them in the next video.
- I'll see you in the next video.

## 5. My Code Is Not Updating!

### Save Your File

- After changing the code in VSCode, make sure to save your changes.
- On Windows, use the shortcut Ctrl + S.
- On Mac, use the shortcut Command + S.

### Checking File Save Status

- To confirm if your file has been saved, look at the dot on the file tab. Examples are provided below.
- A "dot" indicates that the file is NOT saved.
  Note: Remember to reload the browser after saving your file to see the changes.

## 6. # Parent Child relationship

- In our last video, we learned about the structure of HTML tags.
- In this video, we will start using these HTML tags.
- The first tag I want to teach you about is the div.
- You write the `div` and then hit enter, so vscode auto completes for you.
- This is how you write a div tag.
- We put different HTML tags inside of this div tag to section them all from the rest of the code.
- You can think of a div tag as building a room inside of a house.
- The room is still included in the house, but it's sectioned off from the remaining of the house.
- And if you haven't already, guess, div stands for divider.
- How do we put other HTML elements inside of it?
- This is a div within a div.
- We do know that there is a div within a div by indenting the inner div.
- This also has a name in the programming world.
- We call this a parent-child relationship with the outer div being the parent and the inner div being the child.
- Here's another example of a parent-child relationship.
- In this example, the most outer div is the parent of these two divs and these two divs are siblings.
- This last div here is the parent of this div here, so you can sort of think of this most outer as a grandparent. You can start to see that there's a tree-like structure being built here, almost like a family tree.
- This is also called nesting.
- Nesting is when HTML elements are placed within other HTML elements.
- So far, we've learned about what HTML is, how to structure a tag, how to write a div, how to nest HTML elements, and what a parent-child relationship is.
- In the next video, we will continue our HTML journey.
- I'll see you in the next video.
