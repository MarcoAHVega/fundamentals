# 8. Text layout properties

next let's take a look at text layout properties

### text alignment

first we have text alignment which
controls how text is aligned within its containing box

for example on the orange class which is for the div tag if we add text align
and set it to center

```scc

```

refresh you can see the text is at the center of
the blog

if you specify write

```css

```

refresh it aligns to the right of the container

### line height

the next property is line height which sets the height of each line of text

so line height and we can specify a value of 2

and this sets height to twice that of
the font height

```css

```

refresh and you can see the orange background is
now taller

### letter spacing and word spacing

the next two properties are letter spacing and word spacing which are used to control spacing between letters and words in your text

if we specify letter spacing to 4 pixels
and word spacing to 20 pixels

```css

```

refresh you can see the spacing quite
evidently in the browser

the letters are quite far apart and the
words are as well

so

text align

line height

letter spacing

and word spacing

these are some of the text related properties and values you need to be
aware of
