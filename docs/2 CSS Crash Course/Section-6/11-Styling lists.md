# 11. Styling list

alright next let's quickly take a look
at styling lists

### the list style type property

in the html file i'm going to add
an unordered list so ul tag
an li tag that says bread and two more items
milk and eggs save the file

```html

```

and refresh the browser
you should see the list being displayed

the bullet point though is a solid
circle


we can change this using the list style type property

on the ul tag we can specify list style type

and disk is the default value

we can change it to circle
to display a hollow circle

```css

```

we can also set it to square
to display a square

```css

```

you can set it to none
to remove the markers

```css

```

### set two properties called margin and padding to zero to remove default spacing

but what you should note is that the list also has some default spacing

to remove that we need to set two properties called margin and padding to
zero so margin zero padding zero

```css

```

we will learn about these two properties in a minute but for now keep in mind that you can remove the bullets from a
list

in fact most of the lists in a well-designed web page will not have a
bullet point

this list style type of none is pretty useful

so that is a quick walk through on a few list related properties and values with
css
