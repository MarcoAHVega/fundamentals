# 1. Setup

### browser and a code editor

to work with css similar to html we need two things
`browser and a code editor`

for browser i'm going to be using `chrome`

to write the css code i'm going to be using `visual studio code`

head over to code.visualstudio.com and download the editor

### the prettier code formatter extension

once you have installed in the sidebar click extensions and install `the prettier code formatter extension`

this extension will help with code formatting

### project folder

finally open the editor inside a folder of your choice

i have `created a folder called css crash course`

and i've opened vs code inside the folder

here i'm going to create a new html file
`index.html`

type exclamation and tab to generate a simple html document

within the body tag add an h1 tag that
says css crash course

this pretty much is all the setup we have to do

if you reveal this file in file explorer
and open index.html in the browser you should see the text as expected
now we are ready to learn css
