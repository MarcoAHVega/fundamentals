# How to get the most out of this course

Hi, as a content creator I am constantly working on finding ways to bring the best information in the most efficient way to you, the content consumer.

I am perfectly aware of the fact that not all of us have a multi-screen, high-resolution 30" monitor setup at our disposal, and it can be extremely frustrating to tab between video and code editor.
Here are my suggestions:

#### Setup:

- For PC (Windows or Mac):

  - Dual monitor setup with the second monitor being the cheapest you can find. Coding does not require high refresh rate or color precision.

  - 1 Monitor + Tablet as a second screen. Most tablets are large enough to follow along with the videos and code on the main monitor.

- Laptop (Windows or Mac):

- Second monitor. Again, as mentioned before, the cheapest you can find.

- Tablet:

#### Breaks:

- Take regular 5-15 minute breaks after each project.

- Drink sufficient water and not too much coffee :P

#### Projects:

- Review each project after you finish it and ask yourself the question, "How would you do this differently?"

- I am not perfect and I am extremely open to constructive criticisms and suggestions.
