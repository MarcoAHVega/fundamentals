# Welcome to the very first project.

### Project Description

In this project, we're going to create a simple signature application that records the user's name and the date. The order of the name and date can vary depending on user input.

### Project Details

- We will be using State, a React hook, in this project.
- Our first task is to create a component.
- We will explore inline styles and learn how to use variables and functions in JSX.

### Project Overview

Let me also show you how the project works.
It's a pretty simple project, but that's also the idea here.
We're going to start simple and again, we're going to go into more complex projects.

- Choose a date down here, say today 19 of November.
- Type in your name, for example, Norbert.
- Hit enter and there we go.

### Modifying the Name and Date

There's a name you want to change something here and typing.

- If you type "Laura", it's going to change it up.
- This also capital letters.
- We could also change it up to lowercase or the first letter to be uppercase, and then everything has to be lowercase.
  And there's your date right here.
  So simple application, but a lot to run.
  Let's get started with this project.
