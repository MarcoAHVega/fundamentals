# Inputs and Forms

## **Inputs and Forms**

>

### **=>** Intro

- Welcome back to the eighth section of our course, where we will focus on inputs and forms in React Native.

- In this introductory video, we will clarify some key aspects and set expectations for what we are about to learn.

### **=>** Input Options in React Native

- In web applications, we have numerous HTML elements for capturing user input, such as input fields, text areas, drop-down menus, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more.

- However, in React Native, our input options are more limited. As of this recording, the core React Native library provides only two input components: `TextInput` and `Switch` These will be our primary focus in this section.

### **=>** Expo Expands Input Options

- Expo, an additional toolkit for React Native, offers more input components like checkboxes and date pickers as part of the Expo SDK. We will explore these in a separate section.

### **=>** Challenges in React Native Forms

- Working with forms in React Native presents challenges. We typically focus on four key aspects:

1. Managing form state.
2. Handling form validation.
3. Displaying validation messages.
4. Submitting form data.

- While libraries like React Hook Form can streamline these steps, we will learn how to handle forms manually without external dependencies in this section.

### **=>** React Hook Form

- In the future, we might dedicate an entire section to combining React Native with React Hook Form, so stay tuned for that.

### **=>** Project Setup

- To follow along, I've created a new Expo project named `RNForms`
- You can create a similar project using the command:

```bash
npx create-expo-app RNForms
```
