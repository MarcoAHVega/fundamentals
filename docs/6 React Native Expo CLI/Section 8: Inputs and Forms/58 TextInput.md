# TextInput

## **TextInput**

>

### **=>** Intro

- The Text Input component is a fundamental building block for user input in React Native.

- It allows users to enter text and other data into your application.

### **=>** Getting Started

- Import the Text Input component from React Native.

- Set up your project layout (e.g., using SafeAreaView).

- Add styling to make the Text Input visible.

### **=>** Handling Input

- Create a state variable to track the input value (use `useState` from React).

- Assign the state variable to the `value` prop of the Text Input.

- Assign the `setName` function to the `onChangeText` prop of the Text Input.

- This setup will automatically update the state variable as the user types in the input.

### **=>** Testing on Devices

- Test the Text Input on both iOS and Android devices.

- For iOS, use "command + shift + K" to show/hide the keyboard.

- On Android, tapping the input will bring up the keyboard.

### **=>** Displaying Input

- To display the input value, create a Text component below the Text Input.

- Use the state variable (e.g., `name`) in the Text component.

- Style the Text component as needed.

### **=>** Summary

- The Text Input component is used for user text input via a keyboard.

- Import it from the React Native library and manage its state with the `value` and `onChangeText` props.

- In the next video, we will explore important props supported by the Text Input component.
