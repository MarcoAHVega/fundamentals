# Locofy Plugin

### Introduction

- Instead of starting from Visual Studio code, we'll begin straight from the figma design.

- The link to the design can be found in the description below.

- To be on the same page, open it up on your screen.

### Duplicating the Design

- The first step is to duplicate this design to your drafts by clicking the arrow on top and then duplicate.

- Once done, you should see the same screen as before but now with edit access.

### Installing Plugins

- Having edit access means you can install plugins.

- Right click on the screen, go to plugins, find more plugins and then search for lockify.

- You'll find a lockify free beta which you can run by clicking on it.

### Connecting Locofy Account

- Running the plugin will open a small window on top of your design asking you to connect your local fi account.

- You can create an account and register.

- You'll have to answer a few questions which will take less than a minute.

- Once done, your figma and localfi accounts are now connected.

### Using the Plugin

- Head back to our figma design and start using the plugin.

- You'll see a different screen where you can go through a series of explanation videos about lockify.

- But since you're watching this video, you can skip those and simply click "got it".

### Selecting Your Project

- Here you can select your project if you created one at the start.

- But we're going to create a new one soon.

### Following the Steps

- You'll be able to follow the steps to finalize our application.

- We have about seven to eight steps in total.

### Step 1: Optimizing the Design

- The first step is to optimize the design.

### Step 2: Tagging Elements

- The second step is to tag some elements.

### Step 3: Editing the Styling and Layout

- In step 3, you'll be able to edit the styling and the layout.

### Step 4: Adding Actions

- In Step 4, we can add some actions to make things work.

### Viewing Live Prototype and Exporting Code

- We'll be able to view our live Prototype at all times and even export the code from the local file Builder.

### Creating a New Project

- Let's get started by creating a new project.

- In this case, I'm going to call it JSM real estate and I'm going to choose a framework next.js.

### Choosing Project Options

- You can choose from a lot of options regarding your project.

- You can choose between typescript and JavaScript.

- For now, I'm going to select JavaScript to show you how easy it is later on to switch back to typescript.

- You can choose the styling method. In this case, we're going to use Tailwind but CSS modules style components and even CSS and JS is also supported.

- You can choose your preferred units. I'm going to use pixels and Kebab case.

- Click create and finally we are ready to start going through these local five steps.

### Optimizing Design Step

- Click fix on the optimize design step.

- Here you can choose between two frames because this design contains two pages.

- Once you first open it up, go with the first page first.

- Click optimize and it's going to immediately show you some optimizations for the figma design.

### Tagging Interactive Elements

- Everything in figma is just a rectangle with some text within it.

- If you look at this button right here, it's not really a button even though it might look like that.

- By tagging interactive elements, we can give them some meaning.

### Using Auto Tag

- You can use auto tag which is going to provide you with tagging suggestions which you can approve or we can do manual tagging.

### Editing Styling and Layout

- Now that your designs are responsive and styled, you can move to this step where you'll be adding click actions such as open URLs, changing pages and so much more.

### Adding Actions

- Once you're done with the design portion of your file, it's time to move away from figma to local file Builder.

- Once you're happy with all of the previews, you want to sync the design to lookify Builder to view it as code.

### Syncing Design

- Click sync and that's going to sync different pages to your project that we created before and allow you to do many different things such as create reusable components, Define props, add scripts and meta tags, use the preview mode or even exported sync it with GitHub and deploy it.

### Viewing Code in Builder

- Click view code in Builder.

- The syncing process is going to take about a minute. Once it's done, you can continue.

Certainly! Here's the transcript reformatted in Markdown format as if you were reading it in an editor:

# Web Application Development with JavaScript and TypeScript

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to my course! Here, we will embark on a journey to create incredible web applications using JavaScript and TypeScript. JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language, and TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds types to enhance code maintainability and scalability.

Throughout this course, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript and TypeScript, starting from the basics and progressing to advanced functions. You will also learn how to use them for both front-end and back-end development, enabling you to create full-stack applications with ease.

By the end of this course, you'll have a strong foundation in JavaScript and TypeScript, empowering you to explore any web technology you desire. This course is designed for anyone eager to learn JavaScript and TypeScript or improve their existing skills. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, there's something valuable here for everyone. However, please note that a basic understanding of HTML and CSS is a prerequisite, as we'll use them to build web application interfaces.

## About Me

I'm a software developer with experience working on full-stack applications, and I'm enthusiastic about sharing my knowledge with you.
