- Imagine transforming a stunning design into a fully functional app in just minutes using the power of AI.

- No more wasted hours writing repetitive template code from scratch. Instead, focus on the exciting and complex logic that brings your projects to life.

- In this video, you'll learn how to transform a real estate Figma design into a fully responsive and functional application with the help of Lockify, an AI tool that turns designs into production-ready code.

- We'll use Next.js 13 and Tailwind CSS to create a two-page masterpiece, covering:

  - Search Properties by area

  - Latest properties

  - Contact section

  - Full properties list with pagination and filter layouts

- All of this, of course, is completely responsive.

### The Magic of AI

- The true magic lies in our secret weapon: AI.

- AI tools are built to support developers to ship websites faster, not to compete with you.

- With AI, you can seamlessly convert your design into production-ready code.

- Effortlessly switch between JavaScript and TypeScript.

- Adapt to your preferred styling framework, such as Tailwind CSS, modules, Material UI, or any design.

- If you ever need to switch libraries, you can transition between React, Next.js, Vue, and even React Native in a single click.

- And the best part? You'll be up and running in no time.

- I'll personally walk you through the step-by-step process of using AI to set up your project and automatically break it into reusable components.

- Once AI generates your code, you can sync it to a new GitHub repository or export it as a zip file.

- That's going to allow you to use what AI provided and then add as many additional features as you want.

- Deploying your masterpiece to platforms like Netlify or Oversell is simpler than ever.

- Hey, it almost sounds too good to be true, right? Are we going to use a no-code tool? Absolutely not. It's a low-code tool built to support developers to ship apps faster.

- And to prove this point, we'll take our app a step further and integrate Super Bass to dynamically fetch the list of properties.

- Just imagine the endless possibilities.

### Getting Started

- Now you may be wondering, what prerequisites do I need to get started? The answer is simple: nothing, not at all.

- We provide all the tools that you need, and everything is completely free to use.

- Together, we'll start from scratch, and I'll guide you every step of the way towards success.

- So get ready for a transformative journey that will not only enhance your skills as a developer but also impress potential employers with a remarkable project in your portfolio.

- The power of AI is at your fingertips, waiting to unlock your true potential.

- With that said, let's dive right into the project.
