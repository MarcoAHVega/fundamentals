2. `F` key - Used to create frames.
3. `Shift + A` - Shortcut for Auto Layout.
4. `K` key - Shortcut for the scale tool.
5. `V` key - Shortcut to switch to the move tool.
6. `Command + Shift + K` (Mac) or `Control + Shift + K` (PC) - Shortcut to bring in icons or images.

#### Introduction

- Hello, everyone.
- Welcome to the course proper.
- This video here is kind of like a catch-up video.
- It covers some fundamentals that you probably already know.
- Just to ensure everyone's on the same level.
- I need to make sure that everyone knows what a basic creation of an auto layout is, what it's good for, components, and that sort of stuff.

#### Course Overview

- We'll make these two pages here.
- They're not super special.
- So, if you are reasonably advanced, you can skip this one.
- If you're in the middle or not super confident, just want to make sure you're all good.
- Want a refresher? This is the video for you.
- I'll make sure also to throw in some good shortcuts throughout this video as well to make sure it's valuable for everyone.
- But if you're like, "Man, this is the kind of stuff I already know," that's okay.
- Skip along. We get more and more advanced in the course.
- I just need to make sure everyone's okay. You okay?

#### Auto Layouts and Components

- The short version is auto layouts are great because you can do stuff like this.
- You can move it around.
- It's adjustable, it's flexible.
- I can decide that it's going to be on this different size frame here, the larger iPhone.
- And I can turn things on and off.
- So that's why auto layouts are good components are really good because I might decide later on that this guy here, I'm going to zoom in.
- Okay. He's a component. We make him in this video.
- But I might decide actually in the inside, here he is.
- I don't know. Got this going on.
- I don't know what this is. But because he's a component, okay.
- He's got a hairdo. Looks like my hair bald at the top. Okay.
- Can you see this one adjusts as well.

#### Course Objectives

- So let's revise what an auto layout does, why and how to make components.
- Plus, I'll throw in some interesting things about icons, icon sizes, how to scale them.
- And we'll get the beginning of our project started.
- Would you get on with it, Dan?
- Okay. All right, let's get started.

#### Setting Up the Design File

- I'm going to use the new design file.
- There's lots of different ways of starting a design file.
- You choose the one you like the most.
- I'm going to rename this one instead of untitled.
- I'm just going to double click the title.
- I'm going to call this one `event App V 1.0` and hit `enter`.
- And our first shortcut is going to be the key for frame.
- Okay, there it is. There's the icon.
- And I'm going to put in a phone.
- Now, my advice is to pick whatever phone you are using to do the testing on.
- Okay. I'm going to use the iPhone 14.
- And what I'd like to do is use another size frame as well so I can hit the `F` key again.
- I'm going to use the larger size plus.
- Okay. So the iPhone 14 plus, why?
- Because I guess this course here is showing you how to build components, auto layouts, constraints, variables, all those sorts of things, is so that we can build units that we can use in our designs that are quite flexible and resilient to different sizes.
- Okay. And changes and being used by other people.
- And you know, that's, that's the goal here in this kind of advanced course is doing things that aren't just slapdash is the wrong word for it, but like just kind of like getting stuff done and then moving on.
- We want to make stuff that is really responsive.
- Use on different devices can be used by different team members without breaking it and by you using it in the future saving yourself time.

#### Aligning and Organizing Elements

- First thing we need to do is line them up.
- Okay? So they need to line up at the tops.
- I'm not sure why `Shift + 1` shows you everything on your document.
- Just a couple of little shortcuts to kind of flex our muscles.
- We probably know them already.

#### Importing Icons

- Next one is we're going to bring in some icons.
- So we're going to use another shortcut that we know very well.
- Probably maybe `Command + Shift + K` on a PC. It's `Control + Shift + K`.
- At least in your exercise files, there is a folder called icons.
- Let's bring all these guys in.
- Let's click open.
- Now when you're putting in multiple images, okay, you can click once and you get like the size to which the SVG has been assigned.
- Okay, Sometimes they're huge and you can't even see them.
- They're so big.
- If you've done that, okay, it's like this gigantic SVG or illustrator file you brought in.
- Okay. You can click and drag, okay.
- But you end up with these squidgy sizes you can hold shift to get them in, right? But like, it's not what we want.
- What I want to do is I'm going to undo to get rid of them all.
- Hit that same shortcut. `Command + Shift + K`, `Control + Shift + K` on a PC, bring them all in.
- And it's just easier to go place all and they get kind of stuck in the middle of your document.

#### Creating Components and Auto Layouts

- First up, let's see that they're all inside frames.
- There you go.
- Okay. And I would like to say you I'm going to move them all over here to the edges just to get them off the iPhone frame for the moment because I want to do a couple of things.
- First thing I want to do is make them into components because everything normally ends up being a component.
- I get that asked that question like what should be a component?
- Most things it doesn't hurt to make it a component will help you later on, especially if it's going to be used more than once, like these icons and by more than once, not like necessarily on the same page or even in the same document, maybe it's going to be used in another, you know, a completely new Figma file.
- Okay. You know, it's going to be used for future. Projects it should be component because they're all lead back to that original one.
- And when you make an update, they come along for the ride. Everything be a component.
- All right. The next thing I want to do is I want to make them I've got them all selected here. I want to actually just say make multiple components, not just one giant one.
- Okay? I want to be make multiple components all separate.
- Okay. They all are there. Nice.
- Let's get them to an appropriate size.
- Now, scaling them is easy,right?
- If you got them all selected, hold shift and you grab the corner and they scale down, that works most of the time.
- But in my opinion, it's better to use the scale tool to do all your scaling.
- So it's the `K` key on your keyboard.
- Okay. Or you can just pick it here.
- Okay, use that one because it will scale things like the stroke and effects at the same time.
- If you've ever downloaded somebody else's icons and they're not scaling quite right and the strokes are staying the same and the drop shadows are doing weird stuff, just use the scale tool.
- The other nice thing about the scale tool is over here, you can pick scales, you can say, I want it to be, you know, you're working on a design that's four times the size or half the size.
- What I tend to use it for though is I can type it in over here.
- I can say, All right, I want you to have a good icon size.
- What is a good icon size?
- You can pick any icon size you like, but 32 or 48 is generally a really good icon. Size depends on what you're using it for.
- Where they need to go.
- They can get bigger, they can get smaller.
- It's really common, though, to use multiples of eight.
- We'll cover that later on in the course.
- Why that's so useful.
- Okay. So I'm making them all a height of 32 and you might have done this already.
- You might have clicked off and gone, Oh, I can't handle these.
- They need to be laid out then.
- Okay, I'm going to undo that.
- It doesn't matter. You don't have to do it, but just leave them there because I'm going to select them all and I'm going to hit `Shift + A` okay for my auto layout.
- That's the shortcut for auto layout is `Shift + A`.
- It's the same on Mac and PC.
- So if I seem to be moving a lot too that shift key to be a shortcut because it's the same for Mac and PC and Linux or whatever you're using Figma on and there we go.
- We've got an auto layout so we can do that cool responsive thing at the bottom you saw.
- So they've got components inside of them.
- We've got our auto layout.
- You've done auto layouts before.
- Probably be okay.

#### Auto Layout Basics

- The basics are see the little icon here?
- That's the frame for my auto layout over here thinking where's all my options?
- It's because I'm still on scale. Hit `V` key, okay?
- And everything will pop back up.
- `K` scale gives me some very specific stuff and then I'm going to hit `V` to go back to my move tool.
- Actually, it just typed in there. I'm going to hit cross. Go away.
- All right, so auto layouts normally default to the right one.
- We can go left and right.
- We can play with the spacing.
- Okay, We've all done this before.
- Click and drag the little icon to play with the spacing.
- Let's move it over here so you can see it.
- Okay, You can do it on the document.
- Okay? So you can click on it and I'm going to zoom in a little bit.
- You can see I can drag it on this. Excellent. Easy.
- We can rearrange these by clicking. Just one of them or diving inside of it.
- You can watch this, click it once, double click it to go inside and you can drag these around because I want this to be the first.
- I want the heart to be next.
- And instead you can drag them.
- You can use your arrow keys so you've got one selected.
- Just use your left and right or your up and down, depending on which way you've got this going. Okay.
- And I want the ticket so double clicked it left arrow. I want that one there.

#### Creating Responsive Components

- What I want to do for this one is actually I want to turn the ticketing the ticket option off for the not logged in person because they don't have tickets yet and it's taking up valuable space in our Lo and EV.
- Speaking of lo and EV, let's call it `nav-hyphen-lower`.
- We'll do proper naming later on in the course.
- Okay. But that's going to be my lo and EV.
- I put NAV first so that they're ordered nicely.
- So you can have nav upper nav lower nav side. Okay.
- And what I want to do is double click this guy.
- That's him. And I want to turn the eyeball off on it.
- I can delete them. Okay. I can delete them and watch this actually double click, delete them and he's gone completely.
- Don't want that. Actually, I want to bring him back later on when the person is logged in.
- I want it to magically appear.
- That's the nice thing about auto layout, right?
- Is the spacing is cool, but it's this kind of reflowing.
- Okay, this responsiveness that makes it super useful.
- So I want just those three for the moment.

#### Final Layout Adjustments

- Next thing we want to do is hold space bar.
- Let's get this down here and just dump it in the bottom corner, okay?
- And drag this over here and you can mess around in here.
- Auto layouts. Okay, I'm going to use the center one.
- You can play around with your spacing.
- Okay, so we've got our auto layout.
- I'm going to duplicate it onto the larger phone size, holding down my option key on a mac alt key on a PC and just click and drag it over.
- You get a duplicate.
- Grab the square in the corner.
- Okay. If you don't grab the square, sometimes you can grab the padding and that can be a bit frustrating.
- Okay, so grab the square and I can resize it.
- Look for the other larger size and everything kind of sits in there nicely.
- It's not particularly resilient yet.
- Okay. But good enough to get started.
- The trouble with our auto layout at the moment is that if I then say, okay, great, then said I could turn on the ticket for this one.
- Okay. This is the one where the logged in user.
- Whoops, wrong one.
- So iPhone plus.
- And here I want this one. Turn it on. That's good.
- Okay. And I can double click it and I can adjust it, and that might be enough.
- Okay. But we're here for the advanced stuff.
- We need it to automatically reflow.
- We want it to be responsive, resilient.
- Let's do that in the next video.

### **=>** 4. Designing in Figma with Auto Spacing in Auto Layouts

#### shortcuts mentioned in the text:

1. Command Option C (Mac) or Control Alt C (PC) - Copy
2. Command Option V (Mac) or Control Alt V (PC) - Paste
3. Command or Control key + Forward Slash (/) - Access shortcut search
4. Alt or Option key - Drag both sides simultaneously
5. Alt or Option key - Drag to scale elements uniformly
6. Command or Control key + Forward Slash (/) - Access shortcut search (again)

#### Auto Spacing Between Icons

- Hi, everyone. We're going to look at doing auto spacing between these different icons because at the moment we've got something that is quite manual.
- The problem with it is if we turn on other icons, things don't reflow well, don't reflow very well.
- Everything kind of spills over.
- Whereas this one here, now that we've got the auto setting going, okay, when we turn on our little ticket, you see everything reflows nicely.
- We've still got all our paddings on the left and right.
- Everything is nice and responsive.
- We'll also do a little bit at the end after we learn auto just to add some kind of like rounded corners and interface kind of color in the background.
- A little drop shadow here on our auto layout for no good reason other than to actually make something during this course rather than just learning individual tools.
- Let's make something together.

#### Setting Auto Spacing

- To set this to auto instead of a fixed space between like 98 that I've got.
- All you do is with it selected over here under auto layout.
- Go to the three little dots and let's change it.
- The spacing mode from packed, which means they're squeezing together as tightly as they can, given the size of the icon and the fixed dimension that I gave them in between.
- What you can say is like, don't be packed, be spaced between.
- Can you see just above my cursor there it says auto.
- So it's going to automatically space them out.
- And because there's no padding on the outside, it just spreads out.
- It's doing exactly what I want it to do.
- I just need a little bit of padding either side so I can hover above it.
- If these little pink lines don't appear, it means you probably zoomed out too far.
- They just don't appear when you're zoomed out.
- You're going to be zoomed in close enough so that it can see, you know, it's got enough room real estate to kind of actually show the little pink lines.

#### Adjusting Spacing and Padding

- What I'm going to do is I'm going to drag in some padding.
- Okay. You can do one side at a time. That's fine.
- Or you can undo, undo, hold down the option key on a mac alt key on a PC, and it does them both at the same time and drag them in.
- I've dragged mine in 48. You drag in yours the way you want.
- But the cool thing about it, once I've set my margin these is just auto can you see they just resize to fit.
- And that means now if I edit over here, drag it across holding down alt or option. Watch this. If I drag the corner now can you see it leaves the same margin.
- Because I've decided that I say margin quite a bit when I mean padding, padding and figment in.
- Okay. So I've still got the exact same padding on the outside, which I want for consistency across different apps.
- I've got a bit more space though. And look, auto goes and fills that space.
- Why is that good right now? You'd be like, Yeah, I can do that.
- It's when you have to turn on and off different parts and get things to reflow.
- So at the moment down here, watch this. This is the old one with the fixed spacing.
- If I turn on my eyeball.
- Watch this. If I turn it on, it gets wrecked because of my fixed spacing.
- Okay? It tries to force all of that to happen, and it's just not enough room.
- Whereas if it's auto okay, I can say where it is.
- I can see you turn the eyeball on my ticket. Sold.
- Okay, look at that. Everything reflows auto is awesome.

#### Using Shortcuts for Spacing

- Want a specific padding from the edge for consistency, but these are allowed to jiggle about.
- Now what I tend to do is not use the long way.
- Okay. The spacing mon packed space between is fine.
- Okay. You can do it a quicker way and just replace the number in here.
- Okay. The horizontal space between items.
- Okay. The space between our icons.
- Just double click it and just type in auto.
- It's generally quicker and easier.
- You can kind of see the icon change.
- Look before. After.
- Before. Oh, before. After.
- You can actually type it in down here as well.
- Watch this. If I go undo, you can click it once and you see it says 113 type in auto.
- Okay, we used our shortcut.
- Remember alt or option to drag both sides at once or you can type it in over here.
- You can say actually left and right is going to be 48.
- Or maybe 56, depending on how much padding you want.

#### Designing the Frame

- All right. Next thing I want to do is I want to style the frame.
- This is totally nothing to do with the auto auto layout.
- We just need to do this before we go away because I find that working in a rectangle is fine.
- But if you look at your phone, you'll notice that you don't have a rectangle.
- It's rectangle ish with rounded corners.
- So I'm going to do that to our frame before we move on.
- You can skip ahead if you don't want to make rounded corners.
- I'm going to click on the name iPhone 14 two.
- Click on that frame and I'm going to say you have a border radius of 30, okay?
- And it goes around all of it.
- It's more realistic for a phone, especially when you're trying to do margins and padding.
- You can see it kind of was too close to the bottom, but with the rounded corners, exceptionally too close to the bottom.
- So I'm going to click on my auto layout and I want some padding from the bottom.
- Okay. 24. That's about right.

#### References for UI Design

- If you are thinking what is about right.
- Who makes these rules? You can make your own rules depending on how much you're using the operating system like Android or iPhone, how much you want to mimic it, or how much you want to do your own thing.
- If you are looking and you're like new to UX and you to UI design and you're finding it a little bit tricky, like why did he pick that?
- What I tend to do when I'm working on a component that I don't know much about, like this bottom nav, I'll go check out the iOS documentation or the Google Android documentation.
- Okay, let's look at one of them.
- You can look at either of them.
- Both of them. Okay

### **=>** 5. When and when not to use Components in Figma

>

#### shortcuts mentioned:

1. `command option key` (on a Mac) or `control alt key` (on a PC) - Used to convert an element into a component.
2. `shift two` - Used to jump to what you've got selected.
3. `option key` (on a Mac) or `Alt key` (on a PC) - Used to drag and move elements.
4. `delete button` - Used to delete an element inside a component.

#### Introduction

- Hello, everyone.
- Let's talk about when you should make components, when you shouldn't, and some of the quirky things to do with components when you're making them.

#### Converting to a Component

- All right.
- Let's start by making this into a component because we these are two separate auto layouts.
- And you can see them over here.
- The little icon is not our lovely waffle shape or these diamonds.
- So we're going to convert it.
- And the first thing that's going to happen, it's going to be kind of weird.
- Watch this.
- I've got it selected.
- Okay.
- I'm going to use my shortcut, which is `command option key` on a mac `control alt key` on a PC.
- Okay. And click that, and it's going to convert it into a component.
- Great. What happened over here?
- Okay, It spat out all of these internal components.
- Okay. So these are were inside my auto layout and it went, Hey, you can't be inside of here.
- So they spat them out and left.
- Okay. Instances of those components inside.
- Let's have a look.
- So let's undo it and have a little break down just so you get an idea of what's happening.
- So inside of here are these these are my main components, these rule, all the other components on all the other options.
- And it is best practice not to just leave them on page one.
- A lot of people do and they can work.
- The trouble is, is that we can't have these main components that control all of these inside another main component.
- So when you make it, use your shortcut.
- Remember `command option key` on a mac `control option` key on a PC.
- It goes, You can't be in here and spits them out over here.
- And we've got these components going on over here, okay?
- And they're not even inside of this frame, okay?
- They're just kind of hanging out underneath it.
- So what we can do is that's fine.
- Like, totally fine.
- Let's collapse these up.
- I'm going to grab them all.
- I'm going to turn the eyeball on on this one.
- Okay? Because we turned it off before.
- Grab them all and with them selected, I'm going to just move them over here.
- Let's zoom in on them a little bit.
- If you've got them selected member, you can hit `shift two` and it will jump to what you've got selected.
- And we're going to use this tidy up.
- Just because tidy up is awesome.
- Did you notice before when it's up here, I couldn't do tidy up because the icon doesn't fit.
- So you got to zoom in.
- There it is.
- You're just going to be in a zoom level where this thing fits and just do them nicely like that.
- Great. So that might happen to you, and you might not even notice, and you'll end up with weird stuff kind of hiding under other layers.
- And it's a bit of a problem, but hey, we've worked it out.
- And the other thing is that we're not going to leave this here either, okay?
- Because on the first frame you can.
- Okay. I don't imagine I'm going to put this into another component, but I might do so.
- It's just good practice to drag it off over here.
- Holding down my `option key` on a mac.
- Okay. `Alt key` on a PC.
- Click, hold and drag and just move it over here.
- And what I've got is actually, let's just drag the whole don't drag that.
- Let's drag the actual icon itself.
- Okay? And so I'm going to keep my main component over here and let's keep an instance.
- Uh, on my first artboard.
- There we go. He's now a component.
- This one here needs to get switched out.
- They all need to be the instances.
- And because we've got this setup.
- Sweet. Oh, we should be able to just go.
- You look at that.
- Oh, good. You can see here this one is set up to auto.
- So is this one all controlled nicely by our main component over here?
- We got it.

#### When to Make Components

- Now, the question of when to make components is there's no like specific rule when you're at your kind of initial design stage and you just kind of like messing things around.
- You don't need components.
- It's not until you get that second frame.
- And especially for things like buttons and any icons, they should always be components because you're going to reuse them.
- But like me, you'll end up doing stuff where you kind of like make a, you know, make a little card here and you end up duplicating it instead of making components.
- And then there is nothing controlling them all.
- So you've got to go through and redo everything or at least adjust every single one so you end up bumping into when you need components.

#### Organizing Components

- Last thing about components is that when you're storing your main components off to the side often can be on another page when you've got a slightly larger document.
- Keep them on the same page when the design is quite small, there's a lot of messing around.
- I want to go back to the main components a lot, so I just pop them over the side here.
- But when you've got them over the side, it's really important to put them inside of a kind of a placeholder frame.
- So the key for frame tool, and I'm just going to put them on this, I'm probably going to make it a different color just so I can see the contrast of the white.
- Why are they inside there?
- Mainly? So let's bring this out here so it's not inside of a parent frame, it's just hanging out by himself.
- Still a main component.
- There's nothing over here that you can set the constraints, the constraints are.
- Let's click on this one because it's inside of my phone frame.
- It says, I can set the constraints to the top or the left.
- In my case, probably the bottom left, because I want it to stick down to the bottom of this frame means when I adjust this one, okay, adjust the parent frame.
- Can you see it sticks to the bottom? Perfect.
- But I want to do that for the main one so it sets the default.
- So every time I drag one out, I don't have to change it.
- But over here, look, I can't do that.
- But when it's inside, well, don't do that.
- Drag the name when it's inside. This can you see the constraints appear because it's inside of a parent frame in just like a placeholder.
- I'm not using it for anything else other than to say that is it so that when I drag new ones out, okay, it's got the default of bottom and left.
- There you go.

#### shortcuts mentioned:

1. Command option P (or Control alt P on a PC) - Opens the last plugin used.
2. Command (Mac) or Control (PC) + Option (Mac) or Alt (PC) - Used for various actions like duplicating and measuring distances.
3. R - Shortcut for selecting the rectangle tool.

Sure, here's the text formatted in Markdown with h4 tags, bullet points, backticks for editing, and shortcuts terminology:

#### Introduction

- Hello.
- Let's make this.
- It is just a helper spacer guide and it is an answer to a question I get a lot like how far apart should things be?
- What spacing should they be?
- What size should they be?
- What's really common?
- It's these.
- And what does this do?
- It's nothing.
- It's just a visual cue.
- So when we're designing something, we're like, How big should it be?
- You can look at this and go, It should be about 24, actually.
- 32.
- How far apart should it be?
- Ah, let's use six.
- Let's use 16 plus it'll give me a reason to show you a really cool plugin.
- Okay.
- That'll help do all this kind of documentation for us.
- It's good for this little spaces here, but also when you get on further and start making things like design specs for your developer and maybe design system.

#### Creating a Spacing Grid

- Boxes and plugins spaces between boxes.
- Let's do it.
- So let's make a grid.
- I'm going to do it over here.
- A little spacing grid.
- I'm going to use R for the rectangle tool, hold down my shift key on my keyboard to get the height and width the same.
- And I want my first is going to be eight.
- This is a good kind of like base level.
- If they are linked, they should both become eight.
- Okay.
- The width and the height and I'll hit enter on my keyboard.
- Excellent.
- I'm going to pick a really high contrast color.
- And what I'd like to do is just have multiples of eight as we go up.
- Okay.
- Zoom in a little bit and what we can do is hold down the option key alt key on a PC to duplicate.
- And I'm just going to drag it out a size and I'm going to use my math over here because I am not good at math.
- And to say plus eight, here we go.
- 16.
- Okay, I can do that math, but let's do another one.
- Let's go plus eight.
- And I'm just going to keep going up to a size that becomes too big.
- Let's do that.
- I'm going to do this in speed mode.
- Alright.
- That's probably enough in terms of spacing.
- Okay.
- And things away from the edges of other stuff.
- I feel like that is a big enough.
- Once we get it to 48, that's pretty massive.
- You can keep going up to you.
- I like to see the spacing between things as well.
- So this is good for like units of things.
- How big should your icon be?
- How big should that image box be?
- How far away from the edge it should be.
- Another way is the spacing in between can be quite visually helpful when you're making it, and there's some common sizes for that too.
- So I've got my first box.
- How far away is the smallest distance?
- The smallest is zero, so we don't need zero.
- We can all imagine zero.
- Let's look at the first one is four.
- Okay, so four pixels across.
- How do I know it's four?
- Okay.
- It's if I zoom in, can you see the grid there?
- I can see it's four.
- You can also double-check.
- So with this selected, hold down the option key on a mac or alt key on a PC and you can just kind of like hover over stuff and you can see, look, I am four pixels away, so four six is the next one.
- That's the next really common size not divisible by eight.
- I know this, but it's a really common spacing between stuff.
- There you go.
- Six the next one when we get more pixels away.
- Okay, so eight away from something is it's easier probably just to drag it next to it.
- So completely next to it and just say x and y, please move plus four pixels along the x and so you can get your spacing done.
- Okay, so there's some small ones four, six, eight.
- And then basically we go in either whole or half divisions of eight.
- So I'm going to go 12 for the next one.
- So 12 the next one's going to be 16, which is 2/8.
- And my last one?
- I don't have a last one.
- I probably need a 20 in between them.
- So I'm going to go.
- This one is going to be plus eight plus eight and I'm going to make it 20.
- It's another spacing that I use.
- Now, again, these aren't the rules rules, but often these are really good sizes for things and these are really good spaces in between things.
- Now that's handy, but it's hard to know.
- Well, you can actually click on it and say, Oh yeah, that's 48 and then go off and do stuff and look at spacing and go, okay, how far away should that be from the top about that, hold down your option key on a mac alt key on a PC that's 12 and then go back over there.
- But it'd be nice if they're all labeled.
- You can write them out.
- That is boring and tedious.

#### Using a Plugin for Spacing Measurements

- Let's look at our first plug in for the course so plug ins can be found in this little icon here under resources.
- And we're going to go to plug ins.
- And the one that we're going to look at is design dock for this case.
- Now, there are lots of competitors to this particular app.
- Find the one you like and Design Dock might not be working in a little while.
- Basically when I make these courses, it's about the time that whoever decided to make this plug in decides to not update it anymore.
- So again, this is more of a for instance, than an actual go and use this particular one.
- So I'm going to find it by searching for design dock.
- One word, I'm going to run it.
- This thing opens up.
- It's pretty sweet.
- Watch this.
- If I click on this one, let's move it over here and say, I want give me the height above it.
- Look, Boom.
- This one here, I want the height above it.
- Boom.
- You can't see it, can you?
- There you go.
- And it just makes it nice and big and easy so I can not have to go and measure this.
- Here we go.
- We can use this on future projects once we've made it.
- What I also want to do is click on this and this.
- I'm holding shift to select two things.
- And actually I want show me the outer spacing.
- Oh, very well.
- Design apt plugin.
- Okay, I'm going to do that for all of them.
- I'll be

back in a sec.

- Alright, so that is a sweet app.
- Quick little shortcut.
- Command option P control alt P is to open up the last plugin if you're using it over and over and some of them close down after you've used them, that's a good shortcut.
- I'll make sure that's in the shortcut sheet.
- Okay.
- With this app here, it's great.
- It's made this.
- Can you see it's kind of made an overlaying thing.
- I want them all mixed together and I probably want them all in their own frame.
- At the moment they're in a group that's the little dotted line there.
- So I'm going to select off, grab my frame tool, draw a box around it all and say you have a fill of this dark color and I'm going to have to play with a layer order.
- It grabbed a few of my rectangles and some of the container, not all of it.
- It's a container.
- You go above all of that.
- I've got all my rectangles here.
- We'll do Layer Madness layer on later on in the course.
- Okay.
- For the moment though, we'll go caveman style.
- Just drag them into the right place.
- That didn't quite work.
- There we go.
- Alright.
- This is going to be my measurements.
- Awesome.
- So handy plugin both for what we're doing just here and later on when you start doing specifications for the developer, either a handover document or maybe a design system.
- So this will be what we'll use as a visual guide as we're going through this course.
- Yeah.
- To help with our spacing and knowing how big things should be.
- Alright.
- On to the next video.

### **=>** 7. What spacing should I use for web & app design in Figma

>

#### Introduction

- Hi, everyone.
- Let's talk just a tiny bit more about what `spacing` should be.
- I've given you some `generic` stuff in the last one.
- Where did I get that `magic` from?
- How do you get better at it?
- If you are already quite proficient at your `spacing`, you can move on.
- But if you want a little bit of, I don't know, `help` to make sure things are consistent and easy to work with with your developer when you hand off your app not causing problems or at least being mindful of the developer and what they're going to be working with.

#### Watch this video

- So there are lots of places that your app or website are going to end up, and what will end up happening is your engineer, your developer, whoever you're using to make it, it might be you.
- It's highly likely to be built on top of what's called a `framework`.
- Your developer, she's not going to be going through and putting all the `naughts` and `zeros`, okay?
- They're going to be building on top of things that are built on top of things that are built on top of things.
- So if you are an iOS developer, okay, the developer is going to be using the premade or at least guidelines from `Apple`.
- If it's `Android`, it's going to be this `material` that's what they call their design system and they give you lots of helpful things about how things should be spaced apart.
- If you're going to web, it might be `bootstrap`, it might be `tailwind`.
- So talk to your developer, figure out where it's going, what the building it on, and then have a little read around.

#### Spacing of Seven

- It can be confusing, but we need to get started in these sorts of things so that you can actually, I don't know, begin your understanding of maybe a little bit of `CSS`, a little bit of `code` so that you don't throw your developer spacing of seven because seven is tricky because you can't divide it in half. Okay?
- You can't have a half a pixel.
- You can divide eight and a half, you can have four pixels.
- Let's have a little look at why eight is good as well.

#### Frameworks and Spacing

- So let's look at `material` for `Android`.
- Okay, I'm in their `material.io`, they're on their `version three`. In the future you might be at `version 4` or `5`. Check it out.
- Okay. I'm under `foundations`.
- I'm looking at `layouts`, understanding layout, and it's just really nice to go through and say space between columns is a default of `24 DPI`, which is essentially pixels short for `device independent pixels`. They use this because lots of different phones have different pixel densities. Just consider it pixels if you understand that.
- And when you're designing in `Figma` `DP` equals `px`, so they're using spacing of `24`.
- So make sure when you're building out your little spacer block and you're going to Android first, make your `Gap 24`. That's the default. It's happily divisible by eight, not by chance, or at least it's a really common spacing for the moment.

#### iOS

- Let's have a look at `iOS`, have a read through what they do.
- I think they're using `20` for their margins on their sides.
- They have some different defaults to a lot of other ones.
- And the thing with `iOS` is there is both `phone`, there is `TV`, there is `gadgets`, okay, there is `watches`. So have a little look.
- Whatever you're designing for, there will be documentation online if you're going out to web.

#### Bootstrap

- So you're building a website or a web app, find out is it `WordPress`?
- Is WordPress. Using `bootstrap`?
- Bootstrap is a framework that helps developers work fast. Okay?
- And what they'll end up doing is have a little look, I found this. Okay? The gutters is what they call it. Okay? The space between stuff and the default gutters are `1.5 REM` and you can see there they said `24 pixels`, the same as `material`.
- So if I use `24` as my spacing, the developer is going to like it because it's kind of consistent with `bootstrap` and it's consistent with `Android` depending on where you're going.
- Now there are 100 different frameworks `tailwinds`. People are using this a lot. Okay, to help with their styling.
- You can see in here I found under `bootstrap` calls a `gutter tailwind` causes `gap`. It's all useful to know as a UI designer.
- You can see here what a developer will type in is. They won't actually type in the number. They'll just hopefully be close to one of these. So they'll put in spacing when they're coding to say `Gap is zero`, which is `zero`. `Gap is one`, which is `0.25` of a ream. A ream by default is `16`. So `0.25` of `16` is `four pixels`. So remember that little spacing we had before. That's the minimum one here.
- And it's a good rule to not go three. You know, the divisions become tricky and your developers are going to have to go and override a lot of the framework defaults. You can do it, but your developer will probably just ignore it and use some of the defaults unless you force them.

#### Custom Spacing

- Okay, let's have a look. So `16`, `6`, `8`, `10`. Oh, there's a `ten`. You might decide that in your design that you need a `ten`. Where was it? We don't have a `ten`. We've got `four`, `six`, `eight`, `12`.
- There's no real hard and fast rules on what these can be.
- But if you design for frameworks or understand them a little bit, especially if you know where it's going, if you know the developer uses `tailwind`, great type out all of these.

#### Conclusion

- So the big takeaways is `multiples of eight` are good, but really you should check out how it's getting made and copy that.
- It'll make the transition from `figma` to the actual design and development a lot smoother.
- And you don't have to, but I've got a web essentials as well, which covers a lot of the kind of things that we look at here, like what is a `rem`? What is a `DP`, what is `bootstrap`, what is `Flexbox`? There's all sorts of good stuff that you can learn that will inform your design when you're in `figma`, but kind of outside of the scope of this course, but a little bit of `HTML` and `CSS` and framework knowledge makes you a

better UX designer, in my opinion.

- Alright.
- Was that confusing? A little meandering.
- Anyway, let's get on to some more hard skills in `Figma`.

### **=>** 8. Auto Layout vs Constraints in Figma

>

#### Let's talk constraints

- We covered it a little bit in the essentials course.
- Let's look at making sure that when we go and resize for different phones, it doesn't break.
- What we want to do is be able to have something that is resilient, robust, and responsive all the hours so that when we do change, it comes along for the ride.
- You, my friend, need to be Android Mini.
- Oh, look how quick and easy that is so that you don't break it.
- Your teammates don't break it and it looks the same across all your devices.

#### Getting Started

- Okay, so it's easy. What we need to do is we need to select on our lower NAV.
- We should probably do it to our main component so that if we duplicate it later on, we're all kind of doing it to this one.
- And if you can't see constraints, there they are.
- Remember, they need to be inside a parent frame mine just like a placeholder, just so that I can change it.
- Okay, it doesn't do anything, but I'm going to say, actually, don't be left and bottom.
- Let's be stuck to the bottom, which is good. But I want it to go. Not left, but left and right.
- I want it to stretch out.
- I don't want it to scale in this case because I don't want to scale the contents.
- I just want it to stretch to the edges.

#### Handling Instances

- Now, we can do one of two things because this is actually not one of my instances, so I'm going to delete him.
- And I'm going to drag this one out, holding my option key.
- And now he should be defaulting to left, right, bottom.
- You're like, that didn't seem very useful because we just dragged it out. It's when you move on from here.
- So when you go, okay, I needed two of these now or I need another size, so I'm going to make my Android size.
- I'm going to duplicate this whole thing out.
- Okay. This is going to be called Android.
- Okay. And I'm going to say, actually, it needs to be the size of.
- So I've got the name selected. Let's go to frame. Let's go to iPhone. Let's go to Android Small.
- One of the smallest devices that we're going to design for in this course and you see what happened.
- Oh, look at that. If you don't have it on, I should have done that. You should have had it before and after.
- I think we were stuck at top and yeah, top and left.
- If we don't do that and we say hey, go resize to it. Android small, not very useful.
- It's kind of disappeared off the frame. So let's get it back and I'm going to switch it back to that smaller size.
- There we go. Quite the responsive little component now.

#### Troubleshooting

- Now remember a couple of notes if yours is not kind of resizing how you would want, it's probably that your auto is not set up as the spacing.
- Okay. So you can select it and make sure it's auto.
- Otherwise, it might not be doing exactly what you want.
- And remember, constraints can only be found if it's inside a parent frame.
- Okay. By parent I mean that there's this outside one and that this child is inside the parent without it.
- Okay, that goes away. Now we're applying constraints to the component.
- You can apply them to anything regular old rectangle constraints. As long as it's inside of a parent.
- It can be auto layout, it can be text, it can be anything.
- But you already knew that.
- The other thing interesting about constraints is that they call them constraints here.
- Okay, in Figma. But if you've heard the word Flexbox before, basically those are the attributes we're adding to this.
- They're doing the same thing.
- If you've never heard of Flexbox, it's one of those things to go have a look at.
- It's how it's implemented on the Web side.
- So either you're custom doing it, How can your own CSS or if you're using web flow, they call it flex layouts.
- It's the same thing, components, Flexbox, flex layouts. It's all to do with how children interact with their parent.
- Okay. And you can do a couple of different options in there.

#### Conclusion

- Easy. One last thing is that when you're resizing it, we just typed it in and it kind of redid it all.
- If you just drag it, it works too. Okay?
- It just means you've got a lot of goodness and flexibility because that's what we're trying to do, make things that can't be broken.
- They can be used on lots of different situations. Go constraints. All right. On to the next video.

### **=>** 9. Auto layout shortcuts: Tips and tricks to work with Auto Layout faster

#### Auto Layout Shortcuts

- I'm going to put all the auto layout shortcuts in one video.
- I've kind of smeared them across all the videos so far.
- I'll put them all in one place so you can come back to them later on.
- Bookmark this video if you want to make auto layout easy.

#### Selecting Auto Layout Elements

- Select them all.
- `Shift + A` (Auto Layout).

#### Breaking Up Auto Layout

- Need to break up an auto layout.
- It's kind of the same.
- `Shift + A` + `Option` (on a Mac) or on a PC.
- Hit all those, and it goes backwards.
- It's just a frame, not an auto layout.

#### Adding Elements to Auto Layout

- To add things to an auto frame, you can:

  - Click once.
  - Double click.
  - Click the item that's in the auto frame.
  - Copy and paste it.
  - Use `Command` or `Control + D` for duplication.
  - Add by dragging.

- Note: Can't drag into the instance.

#### Main Components in Auto Layout

- Main one rules everything.
- Even if you put more than you need so that you can toggle visibility.
- Main components can't go inside other components.
- You can put main components inside an auto layout (not a component).
- Can't nest main components inside each other.

#### Padding Shorthand

- Select the component instance.
- Shorthand for padding:
  - `0` `Tab` `0` `Tab` `0` `Tab` `0` (To remove all padding).
  - Specify values like `48` (applies to both sides).
  - Use commas to separate values like `64, 8`.

#### Copy and Paste in Auto Layout

- You can copy and paste parts of an auto layout.
- Shortcut to copy: `Command + Option + C` (Mac) or `Control + Alt + C` (PC).
- Paste using `Command + Option + V` (Mac) or `Control + Alt + V` (PC).
- Note: Absolute fixed height may affect pasting.

#### Moving Elements

- Click and use arrows left and right to move elements.

#### Conclusion

- These are our auto layout shortcuts.
- They'll be in your shortcut sheet that you can download and we'll keep practicing them throughout the course.
- Next video.
