title and I want this heading to display get and contact then I'll add a paragraph with the class of contact underscore underscore description and for the content I'll head over to My Demo copy the text and paste it inside the paragraph element lastly I'll add an anchor element with the class of a contact underscore underscore button and our n utility class on our demo when I click on this button it opens a new tab where I can send an email for me it's Gmail because that's what I have set up as a default if you go on the demo yourself and click on this button you might get a different result depending on your device and browser settings you might be thinking why not set up a form so that people can send us emails through a form the issue it forms is that they don't allow for back and forth emails forms are great for freelancing but if it's for a hiring position the person trying to reach out to you doesn't want to use your form they want your email and they want to be able to reach out to you through their own means which is why I chose to have a simple button here forms are better suited for other use cases like a payment form or a survey form for example but that's just my opinion you could always extend this portfolio add a form yourself and use a service like formspree to make your forms send emails to you anyways back in our HTML to make our button be an email button all I have to do is inside the href attribute say mail to Colin and our email so for me slaying the dragon dot IO gmail.com in our Dev server clicking on the button we see it works however I want this to open in a new tab so after the href attribute I'll add a Target attribute of underscore blank this will open our mail to in a separate tab in the past when we would use Target underscore blank we would need to also Define a Rel attribute of no opener note referrer but this isn't necessary anymore all major browsers now do this automatic likely all that no opener and no referred it was prevent a security issue from being exploited when using a target of blank I can remove it now because as of 2021 browsers do this automatically for us inside our components folder I'll create a new file called contact.css I need to import contact.css inside our main.js I'll import it after work.css but before utils.css I'll go to my utils.css file copy the commented.media queries and paste them inside our contact.css file I want the entire section to be in the middle so above all of the media queries I'll select the entire section by its class and give it a display a flex the flex direction of column the Justified content of Center the Align items of Center a text align of Center and a gap of one REM next I'll select the title bytes class name and give it a font size of 2XL a color of light and a text transform of capitalize I'll select the paragraph by its class name and give it a font size of small a color of slate 600 and a Max width of 60 ch lastly I'll select the button by its class name and give it a font size of small I'll copy literally everything uncomment the extra small media query and paste everything inside it on the contact the only thing I want to change is the gap from one REM to 1.5 gram everything else can be removed on the title I'll increase the font size from 2XL to 3XL everything else can be removed on the paragraph I'll increase the font size from small to base everything else can be removed and finally on the button I'll increase the font size from small to base I'll copy all four classes we can skip the small and medium breakpoints uncomment both the large and extra large media queries and paste our four classes inside both of them inside our large media query I don't want to change the gap on the contact so I'll remove this class from this breakpoint I'll increase the title from 3XL to 4XL I'll increase both the paragraph and the buttons font size from base to large then inside the extra large media query I'll increase the gap up from 1.5 Ram to 2 RAM the font size on the title to 5xl the font size on the paragraph to Excel and the font size on the button to excel we're done with this section looking at our Dev server we see
